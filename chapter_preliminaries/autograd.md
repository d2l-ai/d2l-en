# Automatic Differentiation
:label:`sec_autograd`

As we have explained in :numref:`sec_calculus`,
differentiation is a crucial step in nearly all deep learning optimization algorithms.
While the calculations for taking these derivatives are straightforward,
requiring only some basic calculus, 
for complex models, working out the updates by hand
can be a pain (and often error-prone).

The `autograd` package expedites this work 
by automatically calculating derivatives. 
And while many other libraries require 
that we compile a symbolic graph to take automatic derivatives, 
`autograd` allows us to take derivatives 
while writing  ordinary imperative code. 
Every time we pass data through our model, 
`autograd` builds a graph on the fly, 
tracking which data combined through 
which operations to produce the output. 
This graph enables `autograd` 
to subsequently backpropagate gradients on command. 
Here, *backpropagate* simply means to trace through the *computational graph*, 
filling in the partial derivatives with respect to each parameter.

```{.python .input  n=1}
from mxnet import autograd, np, npx
npx.set_np()
```

## A Simple Example

As a toy example, say that we are interested 
in differentiating the function 
$y = 2\mathbf{x}^{\top}\mathbf{x}$ 
with respect to the column vector $\mathbf{x}$. 
To start, let us create the variable `x` and assign it an initial value.

```{.python .input  n=2}
x = np.arange(4)
x
```

Note that before we even calculate the gradient 
of $y$ with respect to $\mathbf{x}$, 
we will need a place to store it. 
It is important that we do not allocate new memory
every time we take a derivative with respect to a parameter
because we will often update the same parameters 
thousands or millions of times 
and could quickly run out of memory.

Note also that a gradient of a scalar-valued function
with respect to a vector $\mathbf{x}$
is itself vector-valued and has the same shape as $\mathbf{x}$.
Thus it is intuitive that in code, 
we will access a gradient taken with respect to `x` 
as an attribute of the `ndarray` `x` itself.
We allocate memory for an `ndarray`'s gradient
by invoking its `attach_grad` method.

```{.python .input  n=3}
x.attach_grad()
```

After we calculate a gradient taken with respect to `x`, 
we will be able to access it via the `grad` attribute. 
As a safe default, `x.grad` is initialized as an array containing all zeros.
That is sensible because our most common use case 
for taking gradient in deep learning is to subsequently 
update parameters by adding (or subtracting) the gradient
to maximize (or minimize) the differentiated function.
By initializing the gradient to an array of zeros,
we ensure that any update accidentally executed 
before a gradient has actually been calculated
will not alter the parameters' value.

```{.python .input  n=4}
x.grad
```

Now let us calculate $y$. 
Because we wish to subsequently calculate gradients, 
we want MXNet to generate a computation graph on the fly. 
We could imagine that MXNet would be turning on a recording device 
to capture the exact path by which each variable is generated.

Note that building the computational graph 
requires a nontrivial amount of computation. 
So MXNet will only build the graph when explicitly told to do so. 
We can invoke this behavior by placing our code 
inside a `with autograd.record():` block.

```{.python .input  n=5}
with autograd.record():
    y = 2 * np.dot(x, x)
y
```

Since `x` is an `ndarray` of length 4, 
`np.dot` will perform an inner product of `x` and `x`,
yielding the scalar output that we assign to `y`. 
Next, we can automatically calculate the gradient of `y`
with respect to each component of `x` 
by calling `y`'s `backward` function.

```{.python .input  n=6}
y.backward()
```

If we recheck the value of `x.grad`, we will find its contents overwritten by the newly calculated gradient.

```{.python .input  n=7}
x.grad
```

The gradient of the function $y = 2\mathbf{x}^{\top}\mathbf{x}$ 
with respect to $\mathbf{x}$ should be $4\mathbf{x}$. 
Let us quickly verify that our desired gradient was calculated correctly.
If the two `ndarray`s are indeed the same, 
then the equality between them holds at every position.

```{.python .input  n=8}
x.grad == 4 * x
```

If we subsequently compute the gradient of another variable
whose value was calculated as a function of `x`, 
the contents of `x.grad` will be overwritten.

```{.python .input  n=9}
with autograd.record():
    y = x.sum()
y.backward()
x.grad
```

## Backward for Non-Scalar Variables

Technically, when `y` is not a scalar, 
the most natural interpretation of the gradient of `y` (a vector of length $m$)
with respect to `x` (a vector of length $n$) is the *Jacobian* (an $m\times n$ matrix).
For higher-order and higher-dimensional `y` and `x`, 
the Jacobian could be a gnarly high-order tensor. 

However, while these more exotic objects do show up 
in advanced machine learning (including in deep learning),
more often when we are calling backward on a vector,
we are trying to calculate the derivatives of the loss functions
for each constituent of a *batch* of training examples.
Here, our intent is not to calculate the Jacobian
but rather the sum of the partial derivatives 
computed individually for each example in the batch.

Thus when we invoke `backward` on a vector-valued variable `y`,
which is a function of `x`,
MXNet assumes that we want the sum of the gradients.
In short, MXNet will create a new scalar variable 
by summing the elements in `y`,
and compute the gradient of that scalar variable with respect to `x`.

```{.python .input  n=10}
with autograd.record():  # y is a vector
    y = x * x
y.backward()

u = x.copy()
u.attach_grad()
with autograd.record():  # v is scalar
    v = (u * u).sum()
v.backward()

x.grad == u.grad
```

## Advanced Autograd

Already you know enough to employ `autograd` and `ndarray` 
successfully to develop many practical models. 
While the rest of this section is not necessary just yet,
we touch on a few advanced topics for completeness. 

### Detach Computations

Sometimes, we wish to  move some calculations 
outside of the recorded computation graph. 
For example, say that `y` was calculated as a function of `x`.
And that subsequently `z` was calcatated a function of both `y` and `x`. 
Now, imagine that we wanted to calculate 
the gradient of `z` with respect to `x`,
but wanted for some reason to treat `y` as a constant,
and only take into account the role 
that `x` played after `y` was calculated.

Here, we can call `u = y.detach()` to return a new variable 
that has the same values as `y` but discards any information
about how `u` was computed. 
In other words, the gradient will not flow backwards through `u` to `x`. 
This will provide the same functionality as if we had
calculated `u` as a function of `x` outside of the `autograd.record` scope, 
yielding a `u` that will be treated as a constant in any called to `backward`. 
The following backward computes $\partial (u \odot x)/\partial x$ 
instead of $\partial (x \odot x \odot x) /\partial x$,
where $\odot$ stands for elementwise multiplication.

```{.python .input  n=11}
with autograd.record():
    y = x * x
    u = y.detach()
    z = u * x
z.backward()
x.grad == u
```

Since the computation of $y$ was recorded, 
we can subsequently call `y.backward()` to get $\partial y/\partial x = 2x$.

```{.python .input  n=12}
y.backward()
x.grad == 2 * x
```

## Attach Gradients to Internal Variables

Attaching gradients to a variable `x` implicitly calls `x=x.detach()`. 
If `x` is computed based on other variables, 
this part of computation will not be used in the backward function.

```{.python .input  n=13}
y = np.ones(4) * 2
y.attach_grad()
with autograd.record():
    u = x * y
    u.attach_grad()  # implicitly run u = u.detach()
    z = u + x
z.backward()
print(x.grad, '\n', u.grad, '\n', y.grad)
```

## Head gradients

Detaching allows to breaks the computation into several parts. We could use chain rule :numref:`sec_math` to compute the gradient for the whole computation.  Assume $u = f(x)$ and $z = g(u)$, by chain rule we have $\frac{dz}{dx} = \frac{dz}{du} \frac{du}{dx}.$ To compute $\frac{dz}{du}$, we can first detach $u$ from the computation and then call `z.backward()` to compute the first term.

```{.python .input  n=14}
y = np.ones(4) * 2
y.attach_grad()
with autograd.record():
    u = x * y
    v = u.detach()  # u still keeps the computation graph
    v.attach_grad()
    z = v + x
z.backward()
print(x.grad, '\n', y.grad)
```

Subsequently, we can call `u.backward()` to compute the second term, 
but pass the first term as the head gradients to multiply both terms 
so that `x.grad` will contains $\frac{dz}{dx}$ instead of $\frac{du}{dx}$.

```{.python .input  n=15}
u.backward(v.grad)
print(x.grad, '\n', y.grad)
```

## Computing the Gradient of Python Control Flow

One benefit of using automatic differentiation 
is that even if building the computational graph of a function 
required passing through a maze of Python control flow 
(e.g., conditionals, loops, and arbitrary function calls), 
we can still calculate the gradient of the resulting variable. 
In the following snippet, note that 
the number of iterations of the `while` loop 
and the evaluation of the `if` statement
both depend on the value of the input `b`.

```{.python .input  n=16}
def f(a):
    b = a * 2
    while np.abs(b).sum() < 1000:
        b = b * 2
    if b.sum() > 0:
        c = b
    else:
        c = 100 * b
    return c
```

Again to compute gradients, we just need to `record` the calculation
and then call the `backward` function.

```{.python .input  n=17}
a = np.random.normal()
a.attach_grad()
with autograd.record():
    d = f(a)
d.backward()
```

We can now analyze the `f` function defined above. 
Note that it is piecewise linear in its input `a`. 
In other words, for any `a` there exists some constant 
such that for a given range `f(a) = g * a`. 
Consequently `d / a` allows us to verify that the gradient is correct:

```{.python .input  n=18}
a.grad == (d / a)
```

## Training Mode and Prediction Mode

As we have seen, after we call `autograd.record`, 
MXNet logs the operations in the following block. 
There is one more subtle detail to be aware of.
Additionally, `autograd.record` will change 
the running mode from *prediction* mode to *training* mode. 
We can verify this behavior by calling the `is_training` function.

```{.python .input  n=19}
print(autograd.is_training())
with autograd.record():
    print(autograd.is_training())
```

When we get to complicated deep learning models,
we will encounter some algorithms where the model
behaves differently during training and 
when we subsequently use it to make predictions. 
The popular neural network techniques *dropout* :numref:`sec_dropout` 
and *batch normalization* :numref:`sec_batch_norm`
both exhibit this characteristic.
In other cases, our models may store auxiliary variables in *training* mode 
for purposes of make computing gradients easier 
that are not necessary at prediction time. 
We will cover these differences in detail in later chapters. 


## Summary

* MXNet provides an `autograd` package to automate the calculation of derivatives. To use it, we first attach gradients to those variables with respect to which we desire partial derivartives. We then record the computation of our target value, executed its backward function, and access the resulting gradient via our variable's `grad` attribute.
* We can detach gradients and pass head gradients to the backward function to control the part of the computation will be used in the backward function.
* The running modes of MXNet include *training mode* and *prediction mode*. We can determine the running mode by calling `autograd.is_training()`.

## Exercises

1. Try to run `y.backward()` twice.
1. In the control flow example where we calculate the derivative of `d` with respect to `a`, what would happen if we changed the variable `a` to a random vector or matrix. At this point, the result of the calculation `f(a)` is no longer a scalar. What happens to the result? How do we analyze this?
1. Redesign an example of finding the gradient of the control flow. Run and analyze the result.
1. In a second-price auction (such as in eBay or in computational advertising), the winning bidder pays the second-highest price. Compute the gradient of the final price with respect to the winning bidder's bid using `autograd`. What does the result tell you about the mechanism? If you are curious to learn more about second-price auctions, check out this paper by [Edelman, Ostrovski and Schwartz, 2005](https://www.benedelman.org/publications/gsp-060801.pdf).
1. Why is the second derivative much more expensive to compute than the first derivative?
1. Derive the head gradient relationship for the chain rule. If you get stuck, use the ["Chain Rule" article on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule).
1. Assume $f(x) = \sin(x)$. Plot $f(x)$ and $\frac{df(x)}{dx}$ on a graph, where you computed the latter without any symbolic calculations, i.e., without exploiting that $f'(x) = \cos(x)$.
