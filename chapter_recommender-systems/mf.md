# Matrix Factorization for Recommender Systems

The first version of matrix factorization algorithm is proposed by simon funk in a famous [blog
post](https://sifter.org/~simon/journal/20061211.html) in which he described the idea of factorizing the interaction matrix. It then became widely known due to the Netflix contest. In 2006, Netflix, a media-streaming and video-rental company, announced a contest to improve its recommender systems.  The first team that can improve on the Netflix baseline by 10 percent will win a one million USD prize.  This contest attracted
a lot of attention and created the hype of recommender systems research. Later on, the grand prize was won by the BellKor's Pragmatic Chaos team, a combined team of BellKor, Pragmatic Theory and BigChaos. Although it is an ensemble method that finally get the best score, matrix factorization plays a critical role in the final blend. The technical report: [the Netflix Grand Prize solution](https://www.netflixprize.com/assets/GrandPrize2009_BPC_BigChaos.pdf), provides a detailed introduction to the algorithm employed. In this section, we will dive into the details of the matrix factorization algorithm and its implementation.

  

## The Matrix Factorization Model

Matrix factorization is a class of collaborative filtering algorithms. Simply put, matrix factorization factorizes the user-item interaction matrix into the product of two lower-rank matrices.  Let $\mathbf{R}  \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times N}$ denote the interaction matrix with $M$ users and $N$ items, and the values of $\mathbf{R}$ represent explicit ratings. It will be factorized into a user latent matrix $\mathbf{P} \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times k}$ and an item latent matrix $\mathbf{Q} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times k}$, where $k << M, N$.  These factors might measure obvious dimensions such as movies' genres or completely uninterpretable.  For a given item $i$, the elements of $\mathbf{Q}_i$ measure the extent to which the item possesses those characteristics. For a given user $u$, the elements of $\mathbf{P}_u$ measure the extent of interest the user has in items' corresponding characteristics.  The predicted ratings can be estimated by 

$$\hat{\mathbf{R}} = \mathbf{PQ}^T$$

One major problem of this prediction rule is that users/items biases can not be modelled. For example, some users tend to give high ratings or some items get lower ratings due to poor quality. These biases are commonplace in real-world applications. To capture these biases, user specific and item specific bias terms are introduced. Specifically, the predicted rating user $u$ gives to item $i$ is caculated by

$$
\hat{\mathbf{R}}_{ui} = \mathbf{P}_u\mathbf{Q}^T_i + b_u + b_i
$$

Then, we train this model by minimizing the mean squared error between predicted rating scores and real rating scores.  The objective function is defined as follows.

$$
\underset{\mathbf{P}_*, \mathbf{Q}_*, b_*}{\arg \min} \sum_{(u, i) \in \mathcal{K}} \parallel \mathbf{R}_{ui} -
\hat{\mathbf{R}}_{ui} \parallel^2 + \lambda (\parallel \mathbf{P} \parallel^2_F + \parallel \mathbf{Q}
\parallel^2_F + b_u^2 + b_i^2 )
$$

where $\lambda$ denotes the regularization rate. The $(u, i)$ pairs for which $\mathbf{R}_{ui}$ is known are stored in the set
$\mathcal{K}=\{(u, i) | \mathbf{R}_{ui} \text{ is known}\}$. The model parameters can be learnt with standard optimizer such as  SGD, Adam or AdaGrad. 

An intuitive illustration of the matrix factorization algorithm is shown below:

In the rest of this section, we will explain the implemenation of matrix factorization and train it on the MovieLens dataset.

```{.python .input  n=1}
import d2l
from mxnet import autograd, init, gluon, np, npx
from mxnet.gluon import nn
import mxnet as mx
npx.set_np()
```

## Model Implementation

Firstly, we implement the matrix factorization algorithm described above. The user and item latent factors can be created with the `nn.Embedding` provided by Gluon. The (`input_dim`) is the number of items/users and the (`output_dim`) is the dimension of the latent factors ($k$).  We can also use `nn.Embedding` to create the user/item biases by setting the `output_dim` to one. In the forward function, user and item ids are used to look up those embeddings.

```{.python .input  n=2}
class MF(nn.Block):
    def __init__(self, num_factors, num_users, num_items, **kwargs):
        super(MF, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.user_embeddings = nn.Embedding(num_users, num_factors)
        self.item_embeddings = nn.Embedding(num_items, num_factors)
        self.user_bias = nn.Embedding(num_users, 1)
        self.item_bias = nn.Embedding(num_items, 1)

    def forward(self, user_id, item_id):
        p_u = self.user_embeddings(user_id)
        q_u = self.item_embeddings(item_id)
        b_u = self.user_bias(user_id)
        b_i = self.item_bias(item_id)
        outputs = (p_u * q_u).sum(axis=1) + np.squeeze(b_u) + np.squeeze(b_i)
        return outputs.flatten()
```

## Evaluation Measures

We then implement the RMSE (root-mean-square error) measurement, which is commonly used to measure the differences between rating scores predicted by the model and the ratings actually observed. RMSE is defined below: 

$$
RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{|\mathcal{T}|}\sum_{(u,i) \in \mathcal{T}}(\mathbf{R}_{ui} -\hat{\mathbf{R}}_{ui})^2}
$$

where $\mathcal{T}$ is the test set. Here, instead of implementing it by ourselves, we use the RMSE function provided by `mx.metric`.

```{.python .input  n=3}
def evaluator(net, test_iter, ctx):
    rmse = mx.metric.RMSE() # Get the RMSE
    rmse_list = []
    for idx, (users, items, ratings) in enumerate(test_iter):
        u = gluon.utils.split_and_load(users, ctx, even_split=False)
        i = gluon.utils.split_and_load(items, ctx, even_split=False)
        r_ui = gluon.utils.split_and_load(ratings, ctx, even_split=False)
        r_hat = [net(u, i) for u, i in zip(u, i)]
        rmse.update(labels=r_ui, preds=r_hat)
        rmse_list.append(rmse.get()[1])
    return float(np.mean(np.array(rmse_list)))
```

## Train and Evaluate the Model


In the training function, we adopt the L2 loss with weight decay. The weight decay mechinsim has the same effects as the L2 norm regularization.

```{.python .input  n=4}
# Save to the d2l package.
def train_explicit(net, train_iter, test_iter, loss, trainer, num_epochs, 
                   ctx_list=d2l.try_all_gpus(), evaluator=None, **kwargs):
    num_batches, timer = len(train_iter), d2l.Timer()
    animator = d2l.Animator(xlabel='epoch', xlim=[0,num_epochs], ylim=[0,2],
                            legend=['train loss','test RMSE'])
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        metric, l = d2l.Accumulator(3), 0.
        for i, values in enumerate(train_iter):
            timer.start()
            input_data = []
            values = values if isinstance(values, list) else [values]
            for v in values:
                input_data.append(gluon.utils.split_and_load(v, ctx_list))
            train_feat = input_data[0:-1] if len(values) > 1 else input_data
            train_label = input_data[-1]
            with autograd.record():
                preds = [net(*t) for t in zip(*train_feat)]
                losses = [loss(p, s) for p, s in zip(preds, train_label)]
            [l.backward() for l in losses]
            l += sum([l.asnumpy() for l in losses]).mean() / len(ctx_list)
            trainer.step(values[0].shape[0])
            metric.add(l, values[0].shape[0], values[0].size)
            timer.stop()
        if len(kwargs) > 0:
            test_acc = evaluator(net, test_iter, kwargs['inter_mat'],ctx_list)
        else:
            test_acc = evaluator(net, test_iter, ctx_list)
        train_loss = l /(i+1)
        animator.add(epoch+1, (train_loss, None, test_acc))
    print('loss %.3f, test RMSE %.3f' % (metric[0]/metric[1], test_acc))
    print('%.1f exampes/sec on %s' % (metric[2]*num_epochs/timer.sum(), 
                                      ctx_list))
```

Finally,  let's put all things together and train the model. Here, we set the latent fator dimension to 50.

```{.python .input  n=5}
ctx = d2l.try_all_gpus()
num_users, num_items, train_iter, test_iter = d2l.split_and_load_ml100k(
    test_size=0.1, batch_size=128)
net = MF(50, num_users, num_items)
net.initialize(ctx=ctx, force_reinit=True, init = mx.init.Normal(0.01))
lr, num_epochs, wd, optimizer = 0.001, 25, 1e-5, 'adam'
loss = gluon.loss.L2Loss()
trainer = gluon.Trainer(net.collect_params(), optimizer, 
                        {"learning_rate": lr, 'wd': wd})
train_explicit(net, train_iter, test_iter, loss, trainer, num_epochs, ctx, 
               evaluator)
```

Below, we use the trained model to predict the rating that user `20` might give to item `30`.

```{.python .input  n=6}
scores = net(np.array([20], dtype='int8', ctx=d2l.try_gpu()), 
             np.array([30], dtype='int8', ctx=d2l.try_gpu()))
print(scores)
```

## Summary 

* The matrix factorization algorithm is widely used in recommender systems.  It can be used to predict ratings that a user might give to an item.
* We can implement matrix factorization with standard MXnet operations, and train it with widely used neural network   optimizer.


## Exercise

* Vary the size of latent factors. How the size of latent factors impact the model performance?
* Try different optimizers, learning rate and weight decay rate. 
* Check the predicted rating scores of other users for a speficied movie.
