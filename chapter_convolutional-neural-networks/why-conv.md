# From Fully Connected Layers to Convolutions
:label:`sec_why-conv`

To this day,
the models that we have discussed so far
remain appropriate options
when we are dealing with tabular data.
By tabular, we mean that the data consist
of rows corresponding to examples
and columns corresponding to features.
With tabular data, we might anticipate
that the patterns we seek could involve
interactions among the features,
but we do not assume any structure *a priori*
concerning how the features interact.

Sometimes, we truly lack knowledge to guide
the construction of craftier architectures.
In these cases, an MLP
may be the best that we can do.
However, for high-dimensional perceptual data,
such structure-less networks can grow unwieldy.

For instance, let's return to our running example
of distinguishing cats from dogs.
Say that we do a thorough job in data collection,
collecting an annotated dataset of one-megapixel photographs.
This means that each input to the network has one million dimensions.
According to our discussions of parameterization cost
of fully connected layers in :numref:`subsec_parameterization-cost-fc-layers`,
even an aggressive reduction to one thousand hidden dimensions
would require a fully connected layer
characterized by $10^6 \times 10^3 = 10^9$ parameters.
Unless we have lots of GPUs, a talent
for distributed optimization,
and an extraordinary amount of patience,
learning the parameters of this network
may turn out to be infeasible.

A careful reader might object to this argument
on the basis that one megapixel resolution may not be necessary.
However, while we might be able
to get away with one hundred thousand pixels,
our hidden layer of size 1000 grossly underestimates
the number of hidden units that it takes
to learn good representations of images,
so a practical system will still require billions of parameters.
Moreover, learning a classifier by fitting so many parameters
might require collecting an enormous dataset.
And yet today both humans and computers are able
to distinguish cats from dogs quite well,
seemingly contradicting these intuitions.
That is because images exhibit rich structure
that can be exploited by humans
and machine learning models alike.
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are one creative way
that machine learning has embraced for exploiting
some of the known structure in natural images.


## Invariance

Imagine that you want to detect an object in an image.
It seems reasonable that whatever method
we use to recognize objects should not be overly concerned
with the precise location of the object in the image.
Ideally, our system should exploit this knowledge.
Pigs usually do not fly and planes usually do not swim.
Nonetheless, we should still recognize
a pig were one to appear at the top of the image.
We can draw some inspiration here
from the children's game "Where's Waldo"
(depicted in :numref:`img_waldo`).
The game consists of a number of chaotic scenes
bursting with activities.
Waldo shows up somewhere in each,
typically lurking in some unlikely location.
The reader's goal is to locate him.
Despite his characteristic outfit,
this can be surprisingly difficult,
due to the large number of distractions.
However, *what Waldo looks like*
does not depend upon *where Waldo is located*.
We could sweep the image with a Waldo detector
that could assign a score to each patch,
indicating the likelihood that the patch contains Waldo.
CNNs systematize this idea of *spatial invariance*,
exploiting it to learn useful representations
with fewer parameters.

:label:`img_waldo`


We can now make these intuitions more concrete
by enumerating a few desiderata to guide our design
of a neural network architecture suitable for computer vision:

1. In the earliest layers, our network
    should respond similarly to the same patch,
    regardless of where it appears in the image. This principle is called *translation invariance*.
1. The earliest layers of the network should focus on local regions,
   without regard for the contents of the image in distant regions. This is the *locality* principle.
   Eventually, these local representations can be aggregated
   to make predictions at the whole image level.

Let's see how this translates into mathematics.




## Constraining the MLP

To start off, we can consider an MLP
with two-dimensional images $\mathbf{X}$ as inputs
and their immediate hidden representations
$\mathbf{H}$ similarly represented as matrices in mathematics and as two-dimensional tensors in code, where both $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{H}$ have the same shape.
Let that sink in.
We now conceive of not only the inputs but
also the hidden representations as possessing spatial structure.

Let $[\mathbf{X}]_{i, j}$ and $[\mathbf{H}]_{i, j}$ denote the pixel
at location ($i$, $j$)
in the input image and hidden representation, respectively.
Consequently, to have each of the hidden units
receive input from each of the input pixels,
we would switch from using weight matrices
(as we did previously in MLPs)
to representing our parameters
as fourth-order weight tensors $\mathsf{W}$.
Suppose that $\mathbf{U}$ contains biases,
we could formally express the fully connected layer as

$$\begin{aligned} \left[\mathbf{H}\right]_{i, j} &= [\mathbf{U}]_{i, j} + \sum_k \sum_l[\mathsf{W}]_{i, j, k, l}  [\mathbf{X}]_{k, l}\\ &=  [\mathbf{U}]_{i, j} +
\sum_a \sum_b [\mathsf{V}]_{i, j, a, b}  [\mathbf{X}]_{i+a, j+b}.\end{aligned},$$

where the switch from $\mathsf{W}$ to $\mathsf{V}$ is entirely cosmetic for now
since there is a one-to-one correspondence
between coefficients in both fourth-order tensors.
We simply re-index the subscripts $(k, l)$
such that $k = i+a$ and $l = j+b$.
In other words, we set $[\mathsf{V}]_{i, j, a, b} = [\mathsf{W}]_{i, j, i+a, j+b}$.
The indices $a$ and $b$ run over both positive and negative offsets,
covering the entire image.
For any given location ($i$, $j$) in the hidden representation $[\mathbf{H}]_{i, j}$,
we compute its value by summing over pixels in $x$,
centered around $(i, j)$ and weighted by $[\mathsf{V}]_{i, j, a, b}$.

### Translation Invariance

Now let's invoke the first principle
established above: translation invariance.
This implies that a shift in the input $\mathbf{X}$
should simply lead to a shift in the hidden representation $\mathbf{H}$.
This is only possible if $\mathsf{V}$ and $\mathbf{U}$ do not actually depend on $(i, j)$,
i.e., we have $[\mathsf{V}]_{i, j, a, b} = [\mathbf{V}]_{a, b}$ and $\mathbf{U}$ is a constant, say $u$.
As a result, we can simplify the definition for $\mathbf{H}$:

$$[\mathbf{H}]_{i, j} = u + \sum_a\sum_b [\mathbf{V}]_{a, b}  [\mathbf{X}]_{i+a, j+b}.$$


This is a *convolution*!
We are effectively weighting pixels at $(i+a, j+b)$
in the vicinity of location $(i, j)$ with coefficients $[\mathbf{V}]_{a, b}$
to obtain the value $[\mathbf{H}]_{i, j}$.
Note that $[\mathbf{V}]_{a, b}$ needs many fewer coefficients than $[\mathsf{V}]_{i, j, a, b}$ since it
no longer depends on the location within the image.
We have made significant progress!

###  Locality

Now let's invoke the second principle: locality.
As motivated above, we believe that we should not have
to look very far away from location $(i, j)$
in order to glean relevant information
to assess what is going on at $[\mathbf{H}]_{i, j}$.
This means that outside some range $|a|> \Delta$ or $|b| > \Delta$,
we should set $[\mathbf{V}]_{a, b} = 0$.
Equivalently, we can rewrite $[\mathbf{H}]_{i, j}$ as

$$[\mathbf{H}]_{i, j} = u + \sum_{a = -\Delta}^{\Delta} \sum_{b = -\Delta}^{\Delta} [\mathbf{V}]_{a, b}  [\mathbf{X}]_{i+a, j+b}.$$
:eqlabel:`eq_conv-layer`

Note that :eqref:`eq_conv-layer`, in a nutshell, is a *convolutional layer*.
*Convolutional neural networks* (CNNs)
are a special family of neural networks that contain convolutional layers.
In the deep learning research community,
$\mathbf{V}$ is referred to as a *convolution kernel*,
a *filter*, or simply the layer's *weights* that are often learnable parameters.
When the local region is small,
the difference as compared with a fully connected network can be dramatic.
While previously, we might have required billions of parameters
to represent just a single layer in an image-processing network,
we now typically need just a few hundred, without
altering the dimensionality of either
the inputs or the hidden representations.
The price paid for this drastic reduction in parameters
is that our features are now translation invariant
and that our layer can only incorporate local information,
when determining the value of each hidden activation.
All learning depends on imposing inductive bias.
When that bias agrees with reality,
we get sample-efficient models
that generalize well to unseen data.
But of course, if those biases do not agree with reality,
e.g., if images turned out not to be translation invariant,
our models might struggle even to fit our training data.

## Convolutions


Before going further, we should briefly review
why the above operation is called a convolution.
In mathematics, the *convolution* between two functions,
say $f, g: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$ is defined as

$$(f * g)(\mathbf{x}) = \int f(\mathbf{z}) g(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{z}) d\mathbf{z}.$$

That is, we measure the overlap between $f$ and $g$
when one function is "flipped" and shifted by $\mathbf{x}$.
Whenever we have discrete objects, the integral turns into a sum.
For instance, for vectors from
the set of square summable infinite dimensional vectors
with index running over $\mathbb{Z}$ we obtain the following definition:

$$(f * g)(i) = \sum_a f(a) g(i-a).$$

For two-dimensional tensors, we have a corresponding sum
with indices $(a, b)$ for $f$ and $(i-a, j-b)$ for $g$, respectively:

$$(f * g)(i, j) = \sum_a\sum_b f(a, b) g(i-a, j-b).$$
:eqlabel:`eq_2d-conv-discrete`

This looks similar to :eqref:`eq_conv-layer`, with one major difference.
Rather than using $(i+a, j+b)$, we are using the difference instead.
Note, though, that this distinction is mostly cosmetic
since we can always match the notation between
:eqref:`eq_conv-layer` and :eqref:`eq_2d-conv-discrete`.
Our original definition in :eqref:`eq_conv-layer` more properly
describes a *cross-correlation*.
We will come back to this in the following section.




## "Where's Waldo" Revisited

Returning to our Waldo detector, let's see what this looks like.
The convolutional layer picks windows of a given size
and weighs intensities according to the filter $\mathsf{V}$, as demonstrated in :numref:`fig_waldo_mask`.
We might aim to learn a model so that
wherever the "waldoness" is highest,
we should find a peak in the hidden layer representations.

:label:`fig_waldo_mask`


### Channels
:label:`subsec_why-conv-channels`

There is just one problem with this approach.
So far, we blissfully ignored that images consist
of 3 channels: red, green, and blue.
In reality, images are not two-dimensional objects
but rather third-order tensors,
characterized by a height, width, and channel,
e.g., with shape $1024 \times 1024 \times 3$ pixels.
While the first two of these axes concern spatial relationships,
the third can be regarded as assigning
a multidimensional representation to each pixel location.
We thus index $\mathsf{X}$ as $[\mathsf{X}]_{i, j, k}$.
The convolutional filter has to adapt accordingly.
Instead of $[\mathbf{V}]_{a,b}$, we now have $[\mathsf{V}]_{a,b,c}$.

Moreover, just as our input consists of a third-order tensor,
it turns out to be a good idea to similarly formulate
our hidden representations as third-order tensors $\mathsf{H}$.
In other words, rather than just having a single hidden representation
corresponding to each spatial location,
we want an entire vector of hidden representations
corresponding to each spatial location.
We could think of the hidden representations as comprising
a number of two-dimensional grids stacked on top of each other.
As in the inputs, these are sometimes called *channels*.
They are also sometimes called *feature maps*,
as each provides a spatialized set
of learned features to the subsequent layer.
Intuitively, you might imagine that at lower layers that are closer to inputs,
some channels could become specialized to recognize edges while
others could recognize textures.


To support multiple channels in both inputs ($\mathsf{X}$) and hidden representations ($\mathsf{H}$),
we can add a fourth coordinate to $\mathsf{V}$: $[\mathsf{V}]_{a, b, c, d}$.
Putting everything together we have:

$$[\mathsf{H}]_{i,j,d} = \sum_{a = -\Delta}^{\Delta} \sum_{b = -\Delta}^{\Delta} \sum_c [\mathsf{V}]_{a, b, c, d} [\mathsf{X}]_{i+a, j+b, c},$$
:eqlabel:`eq_conv-layer-channels`

where $d$ indexes the output channels in the hidden representations $\mathsf{H}$. The subsequent convolutional layer will go on to take a third-order tensor, $\mathsf{H}$, as the input.
Being more general,
:eqref:`eq_conv-layer-channels` is
the definition of a convolutional layer for multiple channels, where $\mathsf{V}$ is a kernel or filter of the layer.

There are still many operations that we need to address.
For instance, we need to figure out how to combine all the hidden representations
to a single output, e.g., whether there is a Waldo *anywhere* in the image.
We also need to decide how to compute things efficiently,
how to combine multiple layers,
appropriate activation functions,
and how to make reasonable design choices
to yield networks that are effective in practice.
We turn to these issues in the remainder of the chapter.
