# Word Embedding (word2vec)
:label:`sec_word2vec`


Natural language is a complex system used to express meanings.
In this system, words are the basic unit of the meaning.
As the name implies,
*word vectors* are vectors used to represent words,
and can also be considered as feature vectors or representations of words.
The technique of mapping words to real vectors
is called *word embedding*.
In recent years,
word embedding has gradually become
the basic knowledge of natural language processing.


## One-Hot Vectors Are a Bad Choice

We used one-hot vectors to represent words (characters are words) in :numref:`sec_rnn_scratch`.
Suppose that the number of different words in the dictionary (the dictionary size) is $N$,
and each word corresponds to
a different integer (index) from $0$ to $Nâˆ’1$.
To obtain the one-hot vector representation
for any word with index $i$,
we create a length-$N$ vector with all 0s
and set the element at position $i$ to 1.
In this way, each word is represented as a vector of length $N$, and it
can be used directly by neural networks.


Although one-hot word vectors are easy to construct,
they are usually not a good choice.
A main reason is that one-hot word vectors cannot accurately express the similarity between different words, such as the *cosine similarity* that we often use.
For vectors $\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}^d$, their cosine similarity is the cosine of the angle between them:


$$\frac{\mathbf{x}^\top \mathbf{y}}{\|\mathbf{x}\| \|\mathbf{y}\|} \in [-1, 1].$$


Since the cosine similarity between one-hot vectors of any two different words is 0,
one-hot vectors cannot encode similarities among words.


## Self-Supervised word2vec

The [word2vec](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/) tool was proposed to address the above issue.
It maps each word to a fixed-length vector, and  these vectors can better express the similarity and analogy relationship among different words.
The word2vec tool contains two models, namely *skip-gram* :cite:`Mikolov.Sutskever.Chen.ea.2013`  and *continuous bag of words* (CBOW) :cite:`Mikolov.Chen.Corrado.ea.2013`.
For semantically meaningful representations,
their training relies on
conditional probabilities
that can be viewed as predicting
some words using some of their surrounding words
in corpora.
Since supervision comes from the data without labels,
both skip-gram and continuous bag of words
are self-supervised models.

In the following, we will introduce these two models and their training methods.


## The Skip-Gram Model
:label:`subsec_skip-gram`

The *skip-gram* model assumes that a word can be used to generate its surrounding words in a text sequence.
Take the text sequence "the", "man", "loves", "his", "son" as an example.
Let's choose "loves" as the *center word* and set the context window size to 2.
As shown in :numref:`fig_skip_gram`,
given the center word "loves",
the skip-gram model considers
the conditional probability for generating the *context words*: "the", "man", "his", and "son",
which are no more than 2 words away from the center word:

$$P(\textrm{"the"},\textrm{"man"},\textrm{"his"},\textrm{"son"}\mid\textrm{"loves"}).$$

Assume that
the context words are independently generated
given the center word (i.e., conditional independence).
In this case, the above conditional probability
can be rewritten as

$$P(\textrm{"the"}\mid\textrm{"loves"})\cdot P(\textrm{"man"}\mid\textrm{"loves"})\cdot P(\textrm{"his"}\mid\textrm{"loves"})\cdot P(\textrm{"son"}\mid\textrm{"loves"}).$$

![The skip-gram model considers the conditional probability of generating the surrounding context words given a center word.](../img/skip-gram.svg)
:label:`fig_skip_gram`

In the skip-gram model, each word
has two $d$-dimensional-vector representations
for calculating conditional probabilities.
More concretely,
for any word with index $i$ in the dictionary,
denote by $\mathbf{v}_i\in\mathbb{R}^d$
and $\mathbf{u}_i\in\mathbb{R}^d$
its two vectors
when used as a *center* word and a *context* word, respectively.
The conditional probability of generating any
context word $w_o$ (with index $o$ in the dictionary) given the center word $w_c$ (with index $c$ in the dictionary) can be modeled by
a softmax operation on vector dot products:


$$P(w_o \mid w_c) = \frac{\text{exp}(\mathbf{u}_o^\top \mathbf{v}_c)}{ \sum_{i \in \mathcal{V}} \text{exp}(\mathbf{u}_i^\top \mathbf{v}_c)},$$
:eqlabel:`eq_skip-gram-softmax`

where the vocabulary index set $\mathcal{V} = \{0, 1, \ldots, |\mathcal{V}|-1\}$.
Given a text sequence of length $T$, where the word at time step $t$ is denoted as $w^{(t)}$.
Assume that
context words are independently generated
given any center word.
For context window size $m$,
the likelihood function of the skip-gram model
is the probability of generating all context words
given any center word:


$$ \prod_{t=1}^{T} \prod_{-m \leq j \leq m,\ j \neq 0} P(w^{(t+j)} \mid w^{(t)}),$$

where any time step that is less than $1$ or greater than $T$ can be omitted.

### Training

The skip-gram model parameters are the center word vector and context word vector for each word in the vocabulary.
In training, we learn the model parameters by maximizing the likelihood function (i.e., maximum likelihood estimation). This is equivalent to minimizing the following loss function:

$$ - \sum_{t=1}^{T} \sum_{-m \leq j \leq m,\ j \neq 0} \text{log}\, P(w^{(t+j)} \mid w^{(t)}).$$

When using stochastic gradient descent to minimize the loss,
in each iteration
we can
randomly sample a shorter subsequence to calculate the (stochastic) gradient for this subsequence to update the model parameters.
To calculate this (stochastic) gradient,
we need to obtain
the gradients of
the log conditional probability with respect to the center word vector and the context word vector.
In general, according to :eqref:`eq_skip-gram-softmax`
the log conditional probability
involving any pair of the center word $w_c$ and
the context word $w_o$ is


$$\log P(w_o \mid w_c) =\mathbf{u}_o^\top \mathbf{v}_c - \log\left(\sum_{i \in \mathcal{V}} \text{exp}(\mathbf{u}_i^\top \mathbf{v}_c)\right).$$
:eqlabel:`eq_skip-gram-log`

Through differentiation, we can obtain its gradient
with respect to the center word vector $\mathbf{v}_c$ as

$$\begin{aligned}\frac{\partial \text{log}\, P(w_o \mid w_c)}{\partial \mathbf{v}_c}&= \mathbf{u}_o - \frac{\sum_{j \in \mathcal{V}} \exp(\mathbf{u}_j^\top \mathbf{v}_c)\mathbf{u}_j}{\sum_{i \in \mathcal{V}} \exp(\mathbf{u}_i^\top \mathbf{v}_c)}\\&= \mathbf{u}_o - \sum_{j \in \mathcal{V}} \left(\frac{\text{exp}(\mathbf{u}_j^\top \mathbf{v}_c)}{ \sum_{i \in \mathcal{V}} \text{exp}(\mathbf{u}_i^\top \mathbf{v}_c)}\right) \mathbf{u}_j\\&= \mathbf{u}_o - \sum_{j \in \mathcal{V}} P(w_j \mid w_c) \mathbf{u}_j.\end{aligned}$$
:eqlabel:`eq_skip-gram-grad`


Note that the calculation in :eqref:`eq_skip-gram-grad` requires the conditional probabilities of all words in the dictionary with $w_c$ as the center word.
The gradients for the other word vectors can be obtained in the same way.


After training, for any word with index $i$ in the dictionary, we obtain both word vectors
$\mathbf{v}_i$ (as the center word) and $\mathbf{u}_i$ (as the context word).
In natural language processing applications, the center word vectors of the skip-gram model are typically
used as the word representations.


## The Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) Model


The *continuous bag of words* (CBOW) model is similar to the skip-gram model.
The major difference
from the skip-gram model is that
the continuous bag of words model
assumes that a center word is generated
based on its surrounding context words in the text sequence.
For example,
in the same text sequence "the", "man", "loves", "his", and "son", with "loves" as the center word and the context window size being 2,
the continuous bag of words model
considers
the conditional probability of generating the center word "loves" based on the context words "the", "man", "his" and "son" (as shown in :numref:`fig_cbow`), which is

$$P(\textrm{"loves"}\mid\textrm{"the"},\textrm{"man"},\textrm{"his"},\textrm{"son"}).$$

![The continuous bag of words model considers the conditional probability of generating the center word given its surrounding context words.](../img/cbow.svg)
:eqlabel:`fig_cbow`


Since there are multiple context words
in the continuous bag of words model,
these context word vectors are averaged
in the calculation of the conditional probability.
Specifically,
for any word with index $i$ in the dictionary,
denote by $\mathbf{v}_i\in\mathbb{R}^d$
and $\mathbf{u}_i\in\mathbb{R}^d$
its two vectors
when used as a *context* word and a *center* word
(meanings are switched in the skip-gram model), respectively.
The conditional probability of generating any
center word $w_c$ (with index $c$ in the dictionary) given its surrounding context words $w_{o_1}, \ldots, w_{o_{2m}}$ (with index $o_1, \ldots, o_{2m}$ in the dictionary) can be modeled by



$$P(w_c \mid w_{o_1}, \ldots, w_{o_{2m}}) = \frac{\text{exp}\left(\frac{1}{2m}\mathbf{u}_c^\top (\mathbf{v}_{o_1} + \ldots, + \mathbf{v}_{o_{2m}}) \right)}{ \sum_{i \in \mathcal{V}} \text{exp}\left(\frac{1}{2m}\mathbf{u}_i^\top (\mathbf{v}_{o_1} + \ldots, + \mathbf{v}_{o_{2m}}) \right)}.$$
:eqlabel:`fig_cbow-full`


For brevity, let $\mathcal{W}_o= \{w_{o_1}, \ldots, w_{o_{2m}}\}$ and $\bar{\mathbf{v}}_o = \left(\mathbf{v}_{o_1} + \ldots, + \mathbf{v}_{o_{2m}} \right)/(2m)$. Then :eqref:`fig_cbow-full` can be simplified as

$$P(w_c \mid \mathcal{W}_o) = \frac{\exp\left(\mathbf{u}_c^\top \bar{\mathbf{v}}_o\right)}{\sum_{i \in \mathcal{V}} \exp\left(\mathbf{u}_i^\top \bar{\mathbf{v}}_o\right)}.$$

Given a text sequence of length $T$, where the word at time step $t$ is denoted as $w^{(t)}$.
For context window size $m$,
the likelihood function of the continuous bag of words model
is the probability of generating all center words
given their context words:


$$ \prod_{t=1}^{T}  P(w^{(t)} \mid  w^{(t-m)}, \ldots, w^{(t-1)}, w^{(t+1)}, \ldots, w^{(t+m)}).$$

### Training

Training continuous bag of words models
is almost the same as
training skip-gram models.
The maximum likelihood estimation of the
continuous bag of words model is equivalent to minimizing the following loss function:



$$  -\sum_{t=1}^T  \text{log}\, P(w^{(t)} \mid  w^{(t-m)}, \ldots, w^{(t-1)}, w^{(t+1)}, \ldots, w^{(t+m)}).$$

Notice that

$$\log\,P(w_c \mid \mathcal{W}_o) = \mathbf{u}_c^\top \bar{\mathbf{v}}_o - \log\,\left(\sum_{i \in \mathcal{V}} \exp\left(\mathbf{u}_i^\top \bar{\mathbf{v}}_o\right)\right).$$

Through differentiation, we can obtain its gradient
with respect to any context word vector $\mathbf{v}_{o_i}$($i = 1, \ldots, 2m$)
as


$$\frac{\partial \log\, P(w_c \mid \mathcal{W}_o)}{\partial \mathbf{v}_{o_i}} = \frac{1}{2m} \left(\mathbf{u}_c - \sum_{j \in \mathcal{V}} \frac{\exp(\mathbf{u}_j^\top \bar{\mathbf{v}}_o)\mathbf{u}_j}{ \sum_{i \in \mathcal{V}} \text{exp}(\mathbf{u}_i^\top \bar{\mathbf{v}}_o)} \right) = \frac{1}{2m}\left(\mathbf{u}_c - \sum_{j \in \mathcal{V}} P(w_j \mid \mathcal{W}_o) \mathbf{u}_j \right).$$
:eqlabel:`eq_cbow-gradient`


The gradients for the other word vectors can be obtained in the same way.
Unlike the skip-gram model,
the continuous bag of words model
typically
uses context word vectors as the word representations.
