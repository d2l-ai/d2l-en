# A Taste of Deep Learning

If you are in a hurry, this chapter has all the details you need to
get a taste of deep learning. If you like to take the scenic route, we
still recommend that you read it, since it will explain how to set up
Apache MXNet, how to use automatic differentiation and how to
manipulate data and memory. We also provide quick primers on linear
algebra and statistics, designed to help readers to get up to speed on
the basics.
