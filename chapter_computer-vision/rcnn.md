# Region-based CNNs (R-CNNs)


Region-based convolutional neural networks or regions with CNN features (R-CNNs)
are a pioneering approach that applies deep models to object detection
:cite:`Girshick.Donahue.Darrell.ea.2014`. In this section, we will discuss
R-CNNs and a series of improvements made to them: Fast R-CNN
:cite:`Girshick.2015`, Faster R-CNN :cite:`Ren.He.Girshick.ea.2015`, and Mask R-CNN
:cite:`He.Gkioxari.Dollar.ea.2017`. Due to space limitations, we will confine
our discussion to the designs of these models.


## R-CNNs

R-CNN models first select several proposed regions from an image (for example,
anchor boxes are one type of selection method) and then label their categories
and bounding boxes (e.g., offsets). Then, they use a CNN to perform forward
computation to extract features from each proposed area. Afterwards, we use the
features of each proposed region to predict their categories and bounding
boxes. :numref:`fig_r-cnn` shows an R-CNN model.

:label:`fig_r-cnn`

Specifically, R-CNNs are composed of four main parts:

1. Selective search is performed on the input image to select multiple
   high-quality proposed regions
   :cite:`Uijlings.Van-De-Sande.Gevers.ea.2013`. These proposed regions are
   generally selected on multiple scales and have different shapes and
   sizes. The category and ground-truth bounding box of each proposed region is
   labeled.
1. A pre-trained CNN is selected and placed, in truncated form, before the
   output layer. It transforms each proposed region into the input dimensions
   required by the network and uses forward computation to output the features
   extracted from the proposed regions.
1. The features and labeled category of each proposed region are combined as an
   example to train multiple support vector machines for object
   classification. Here, each support vector machine is used to determine
   whether an example belongs to a certain category.
1. The features and labeled bounding box of each proposed region are combined as
   an example to train a linear regression model for ground-truth bounding box
   prediction.

Although R-CNN models use pre-trained CNNs to effectively extract image
features, the main downside is the slow speed. As you can imagine, we can select
thousands of proposed regions from a single image, requiring thousands of
forward computations from the CNN to perform object detection. This massive
computing load means that R-CNNs are not widely used in actual applications.


## Fast R-CNN

The main performance bottleneck of an R-CNN model is the need to independently
extract features for each proposed region. As these regions have a high degree
of overlap, independent feature extraction results in a high volume of
repetitive computations. Fast R-CNN improves on the R-CNN by only performing CNN
forward computation on the image as a whole.

![Fast R-CNN model. ](../img/fast-rcnn.svg)
:label:`fig_fast_r-cnn`

:numref:`fig_fast_r-cnn` shows a Fast R-CNN model. It is primary computation
steps are described below:

1. Compared to an R-CNN model, a Fast R-CNN model uses the entire image as the
   CNN input for feature extraction, rather than each proposed region. Moreover,
   this network is generally trained to update the model parameters. As the
   input is an entire image, the CNN output shape is $1 \times c \times h_1
   \times w_1$.
1. Assuming selective search generates $n$ proposed regions, their different
   shapes indicate regions of interests (RoIs) of different shapes on the CNN
   output. Features of the same shapes must be extracted from these RoIs (here
   we assume that the height is $h_2$ and the width is $w_2$). Fast R-CNN
   introduces RoI pooling, which uses the CNN output and RoIs as input to output
   a concatenation of the features extracted from each proposed region with the
   shape $n \times c \times h_2 \times w_2$.
1. A fully connected layer is used to transform the output shape to $n \times
   d$, where $d$ is determined by the model design.
1. During category prediction, the shape of the fully connected layer output is
   again transformed to $n \times q$ and we use softmax regression ($q$ is the
   number of categories). During bounding box prediction, the shape of the fully
   connected layer output is again transformed to $n \times 4$. This means that
   we predict the category and bounding box for each proposed region.

The RoI pooling layer in Fast R-CNN is somewhat different from the pooling
layers we have discussed before. In a normal pooling layer, we set the pooling
window, padding, and stride to control the output shape. In an RoI pooling
layer, we can directly specify the output shape of each region, such as
specifying the height and width of each region as $h_2, w_2$. Assuming that the
height and width of the RoI window are $h$ and $w$, this window is divided into
a grid of sub-windows with the shape $h_2 \times w_2$. The size of each
sub-window is about $(h/h_2) \times (w/w_2)$. The sub-window height and width
must always be integers and the largest element is used as the output for a
given sub-window. This allows the RoI pooling layer to extract features of the
same shape from RoIs of different shapes.

In :numref:`fig_roi`, we select an $3\times 3$ region as an RoI of the $4 \times
4$ input. For this RoI, we use a $2\times 2$ RoI pooling layer to obtain a
single $2\times 2$ output. When we divide the region into four sub-windows, they
respectively contain the elements 0, 1, 4, and 5 (5 is the largest); 2 and 6 (6
is the largest); 8 and 9 (9 is the largest); and 10.

![$2\times 2$ RoI pooling layer. ](../img/roi.svg)
:label:`fig_roi`

We use the `ROIPooling` function to demonstrate the RoI pooling layer computation. Assume that the CNN extracts the feature `X` with both a height and width of 4 and only a single channel.

```{.python .input  n=4}
from mxnet import np, npx

npx.set_np()

X = np.arange(16).reshape(1, 1, 4, 4)
X
```

Assume that the height and width of the image are both 40 pixels and that selective search generates two proposed regions on the image. Each region is expressed as five elements: the region's object category and the $x, y$ coordinates of its upper-left and bottom-right corners.

```{.python .input  n=5}
rois = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 20, 20], [0, 0, 10, 30, 30]])
```

Because the height and width of `X` are $1/10$ of the height and width of the image, the coordinates of the two proposed regions are multiplied by 0.1 according to the `spatial_scale`, and then the RoIs are labeled on `X` as `X[:, :, 0:3, 0:3]` and `X[:, :, 1:4, 0:4]`, respectively. Finally, we divide the two RoIs into a sub-window grid and extract features with a height and width of 2.

```{.python .input  n=6}
npx.roi_pooling(X, rois, pooled_size=(2, 2), spatial_scale=0.1)
```

## Faster R-CNN

In order to obtain precise object detection results, Fast R-CNN generally requires that many proposed regions be generated in selective search. Faster R-CNN replaces selective search with a region proposal network. This reduces the number of proposed regions generated, while ensuring precise object detection.


![Faster R-CNN model. ](../img/faster-rcnn.svg)
:label:`fig_faster_r-cnn`


:numref:`fig_faster_r-cnn` shows a Faster R-CNN model. Compared to Fast R-CNN,
Faster R-CNN only changes the method for generating proposed regions from
selective search to region proposal network. The other parts of the model remain
unchanged. The detailed region proposal network computation process is described
below:

1. We use a $3\times 3$ convolutional layer with a padding of 1 to transform the
   CNN output and set the number of output channels to $c$. This way, each
   element in the feature map the CNN extracts from the image is a new feature
   with a length of $c$.
1. We use each element in the feature map as a center to generate multiple
   anchor boxes of different sizes and aspect ratios and then label them.
1. We use the features of the elements of length $c$ at the center on the anchor
   boxes to predict the binary category (object or background) and bounding box
   for their respective anchor boxes.
1. Then, we use non-maximum suppression to remove similar bounding box results
   that correspond to category predictions of "object". Finally, we output the
   predicted bounding boxes as the proposed regions required by the RoI pooling
   layer.


It is worth noting that, as a part of the Faster R-CNN model, the region
proposal network is trained together with the rest of the model. In addition,
the Faster R-CNN object functions include the category and bounding box
predictions in object detection, as well as the binary category and bounding box
predictions for the anchor boxes in the region proposal network. Finally, the
region proposal network can learn how to generate high-quality proposed regions,
which reduces the number of proposed regions while maintaining the precision of
object detection.


## Mask R-CNN

If training data is labeled with the pixel-level positions of each object in an image, a Mask R-CNN model can effectively use these detailed labels to further improve the precision of object detection.

![Mask R-CNN model. ](../img/mask-rcnn.svg)
:label:`fig_mask_r-cnn`

As shown in :numref:`fig_mask_r-cnn`, Mask R-CNN is a modification to the Faster
R-CNN model. Mask R-CNN models replace the RoI pooling layer with an RoI
alignment layer. This allows the use of bilinear interpolation to retain spatial
information on feature maps, making Mask R-CNN better suited for pixel-level
predictions. The RoI alignment layer outputs feature maps of the same shape for
all RoIs. This not only predicts the categories and bounding boxes of RoIs, but
allows us to use an additional fully convolutional network to predict the
pixel-level positions of objects. We will describe how to use fully
convolutional networks to predict pixel-level semantics in images later in this
chapter.



## Summary

* An R-CNN model selects several proposed regions and uses a CNN to perform
  forward computation and extract the features from each proposed region. It
  then uses these features to predict the categories and bounding boxes of
  proposed regions.
* Fast R-CNN improves on the R-CNN by only performing CNN forward computation on
  the image as a whole. It introduces an RoI pooling layer to extract features
  of the same shape from RoIs of different shapes.
* Faster R-CNN replaces the selective search used in Fast R-CNN with a region
  proposal network. This reduces the number of proposed regions generated, while
  ensuring precise object detection.
* Mask R-CNN uses the same basic structure as Faster R-CNN, but adds a fully
  convolution layer to help locate objects at the pixel level and further
  improve the precision of object detection.
