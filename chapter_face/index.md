Recents years, deep learning techonolgy has greatly improve the power of face analysis system. For example, modern face recognition algorithm can surpass humans in intelligence.

The major goal of face analysis systems is to help people understand the information behind face images or videos. Many fantastic applications can become true by the help of high accuracy face analyzing tools, such as face verification, 3D face restruction and emotion recognition.

In this chapter, we will cover some fundamental components of face analysis system, including face recognition, face detection and face alignment. You will learn how to prepare dataset, design specific neural networks for face tasks and effective training skills.
