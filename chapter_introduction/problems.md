## Problems

1. Which parts of code that you are currently writing could be 'learned', i.e. improved by learning and automatically determining design choices that are made in your code? Does your code include heuristic design choices?
1. Which problems that you encounter have many examples for how to solve them, yet no specific way to automate them? These may be prime candidates for using Deep Learning.
1. Viewing the development of Artificial Intelligence as a new industrial revolution, what is the relationship between algorithms and data? Is it similar to steam engines and coal (what is the fundamental difference)?
1. Where else can you apply the end-to-end training approach? Physics? Engineering? Econometrics?
