## Summary

* Machine learning studies how computer systems can use data to improve performance. It combines ideas from statistics, data mining, artificial intelligence and optimization. Often it is used as a means of implementing artificially intelligent solutions.
* As a class of machine learning, representational learning focuses on how to automatically find the appropriate way to represent data. This is often accomplished by a progression of learned transformations.
* Much of the recent progress has been triggered by an abundance of data arising from cheap sensors and internet scale applications, and by significant progress in computation, mostly through GPUs.
* Whole system optimization is a key component in obtaining good performance. The availability of efficient deep learning frameworks has made design and implementation of this significantly easier.
