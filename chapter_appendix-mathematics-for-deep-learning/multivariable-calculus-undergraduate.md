# Multivariable Calculus (With undergraduate emphasis)
:label:`sec_multivariable_calculus_undergraduate`


This section is very similar to the section `sec_multivariate_calculus`.  Both sections review multivariate calculus in the context of backpropagation.

This section exands more of the derivations to show all elements in the matrices.
