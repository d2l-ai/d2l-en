    "# Automatic differentiation with ``autograd`` \n",

    "\n",
    "In machine learning, we *train* models to get better and better as a function of experience. Usually, *getting better* means minimizing a *loss function*, i.e. a score that answers \"how *bad* is our model?\" With neural networks, we choose loss functions to be differentiable with respect to our parameters. Put simply, this means that for each of the model's parameters, we can determine how much *increasing* or *decreasing* it might affect the loss. While the calculations are straightforward, for complex models, working it out by hand can be a pain.\n",
    "\n",
    "_MXNet_'s autograd package expedites this work by automatically calculating derivatives. And while most other libraries require that we compile a symbolic graph to take automatic derivatives, ``mxnet.autograd``, like PyTorch, allows you to take derivatives while writing  ordinary imperative code. Every time you make pass through your model, ``autograd`` builds a graph on the fly, through which it can immediately backpropagate gradients.\n",

    "Sometimes when we call the backward method on an NDArray, e.g. ``y.backward()``, where ``y`` is a function of ``x`` we are just interested in the derivative of ``y`` with respect to ``x``. Mathematicians write this as $\\frac{dy(x)}{dx}$. At other times, we may be interested in the gradient of ``z`` with respect to ``x``, where ``z`` is a function of ``y``, which in turn, is a function of ``x``. That is, we are interested in $\\frac{d}{dx} z(y(x))$. Recall that by the chain rule $\\frac{d}{dx} z(y(x)) = \\frac{dz(y)}{dy} \\frac{dy(x)}{dx}$. So, when ``y`` is part of a larger function ``z``, and we want ``x.grad`` to store $\\frac{dz}{dx}$, we can pass in the *head gradient* $\\frac{dz}{dy}$ as an input to ``backward()``. The default argument is ``nd.ones_like(y)``. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule) for more details."
