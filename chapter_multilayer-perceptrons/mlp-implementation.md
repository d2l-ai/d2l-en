# Implementation 
:label:`sec_mlp_scratch`

Multilayer Perceptrons are not much more complex to implement than simple linear models. The key conceptual 
difference is that we now concatenate multiple layers. Let's begin again by implementing such a network from scratch.

```{.python .input  n=2}
%%tab mxnet
from d2l import mxnet as d2l
from mxnet import np, npx
from mxnet.gluon import nn
npx.set_np()
```

```{.python .input  n=3}
%%tab pytorch
from d2l import torch as d2l
import torch
from torch import nn
```

```{.python .input  n=4}
%%tab tensorflow
from d2l import tensorflow as d2l
import tensorflow as tf
```

## Implementation from Scratch

### Initializing Model Parameters

Recall that Fashion-MNIST contains 10 classes,
and that each image consists of a $28 \times 28 = 784$
grid of grayscale pixel values.
As before we will disregard the spatial structure
among the pixels for now, 
so we can think of this as a classification dataset
with 784 input features and 10 classes.
To begin, we will [**implement an MLP
with one hidden layer and 256 hidden units.**]
Both the number of layers and their width are adjustable 
(they're considered hyperparameters). 
Typically, we choose the layer widths to be divisible by larger powers of 2. 
This is computationally efficient due to the way 
memory is allocated and addressed in hardware.

Again, we will represent our parameters with several tensors.
Note that *for every layer*, we must keep track of
one weight matrix and one bias vector.
As always, we allocate memory
for the gradients of the loss with respect to these parameters.

```{.python .input  n=5}
%%tab mxnet
class MLPScratch(d2l.Classification):
    def __init__(self, num_inputs, num_outputs, num_hiddens, lr, sigma=0.01):
        super().__init__()
        self.save_hyperparameters()
        self.W1 = np.random.randn(num_inputs, num_hiddens) * sigma
        self.b1 = np.zeros(num_hiddens)
        self.W2 = np.random.randn(num_hiddens, num_outputs) * sigma
        self.b2 = np.zeros(num_outputs)
        for param in self.get_scratch_params():
            param.attach_grad()
```

```{.python .input  n=6}
%%tab pytorch
class MLPScratch(d2l.Classification):
    def __init__(self, num_inputs, num_outputs, num_hiddens, lr, sigma=0.01):
        super().__init__()
        self.save_hyperparameters()
        self.W1 = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(num_inputs, num_hiddens) * sigma)
        self.b1 = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(num_hiddens))
        self.W2 = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(num_hiddens, num_outputs) * sigma)
        self.b2 = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(num_outputs))
```

```{.python .input  n=7}
%%tab tensorflow
class MLPScratch(d2l.Classification):
    def __init__(self, num_inputs, num_outputs, num_hiddens, lr, sigma=0.01):
        super().__init__()
        self.save_hyperparameters()
        self.W1 = tf.Variable(
            tf.random.normal((num_inputs, num_hiddens)) * sigma)
        self.b1 = tf.Variable(tf.zeros(num_hiddens))
        self.W2 = tf.Variable(
            tf.random.normal((num_hiddens, num_outputs)) * sigma)
        self.b2 = tf.Variable(tf.zeros(num_outputs))
```

### Model

To make sure we know how everything works,
we will [**implement the ReLU activation**] ourselves
rather than invoking the built-in `relu` function directly.

```{.python .input  n=8}
%%tab mxnet
def relu(X):
    return np.maximum(X, 0)
```

```{.python .input  n=9}
%%tab pytorch
def relu(X):
    a = torch.zeros_like(X)
    return torch.max(X, a)
```

```{.python .input  n=10}
%%tab tensorflow
def relu(X):
    return tf.math.maximum(X, 0)
```

Since we are disregarding spatial structure,
we `reshape` each two-dimensional image into
a flat vector of length  `num_inputs`.
Finally, we (**implement our model**)
with just a few lines of code. Since we use the framework built-in autograd this is all that it takes.

```{.python .input  n=11}
%%tab all
@d2l.add_to_class(MLPScratch)
def forward(self, X):
    X = d2l.reshape(X, (-1, self.num_inputs))
    H = relu(d2l.matmul(X, self.W1) + self.b1)
    return d2l.matmul(H, self.W2) + self.b2
```

### Training

Fortunately, [**the training loop for MLPs
is exactly the same as for softmax regression.**] We define the model, data, trainer and finally invoke the `fit` function on model and data.

```{.python .input  n=12}
%%tab all
model = MLPScratch(num_inputs=784, num_outputs=10, num_hiddens=256, lr=0.1)
data = d2l.FashionMNIST(batch_size=256)
trainer = d2l.Trainer(max_epochs=10)
trainer.fit(model, data)
```

## Concise Implementation

As you might expect, by relying on the high-level APIs, we can implement MLPs even more concisely.

### Model

As compared with our concise implementation
of softmax regression implementation
(:numref:`sec_softmax_concise`),
the only difference is that we add
*two* fully connected layers where we previously added only *one*.
The first is [**the hidden layer**],
the second is the output layer.

```{.python .input}
%%tab mxnet
class MLP(d2l.Classification):
    def __init__(self, num_outputs, num_hiddens, lr):
        super().__init__()
        self.save_hyperparameters()
        self.net = nn.Sequential()
        self.net.add(nn.Dense(num_hiddens, activation='relu'),
                     nn.Dense(num_outputs))
        self.net.initialize()
```

```{.python .input}
%%tab pytorch
class MLP(d2l.Classification):
    def __init__(self, num_inputs, num_outputs, num_hiddens, lr):
        super().__init__()
        self.save_hyperparameters()
        self.net = nn.Sequential(nn.Flatten(),
                                 nn.Linear(num_inputs, num_hiddens),
                                 nn.ReLU(),
                                 nn.Linear(num_hiddens, num_outputs))
```

```{.python .input}
%%tab tensorflow
class MLP(d2l.Classification):
    def __init__(self, num_outputs, num_hiddens, lr):
        super().__init__()
        self.save_hyperparameters()
        self.net = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
            tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_hiddens, activation='relu'),
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_outputs)])  
```

### Training

[**The training loop**] is exactly the same
as when we implemented softmax regression.
This modularity enables us to separate
matters concerning the model architecture
from orthogonal considerations.

```{.python .input}
%%tab all
if tab.selected(['mxnet', 'tensorflow']):
    model = MLP(num_outputs=10, num_hiddens=256, lr=0.1)
if tab.selected(['pytorch']):
    model = MLP(num_inputs=784, num_outputs=10, num_hiddens=256, lr=0.1)
trainer.fit(model, data)
```

## Summary

Now that we have more practice in designing deep networks, the step from a single to multiple layers of deep networks doesn't pose such a significant challenge any longer. In particular, we can re-use the training algorithm and data loader. Note, though, that implementing MLPs from scratch is nonetheless messy: Naming and keeping track of the model parameters makes it difficult to extend models. For instance, imagine wanting to insert another layer between layers 42 and 43. This might now be layer 42b, unless we are willing to perform sequential renaming. Moreover, if we implement the network from scratch, it is much more difficult for the framework to perform meaningful performance optimizations. 

Nonetheless, you have now reached the state of the art of the late 1980s when fully connected deep networks were the method of choice for neural network modeling. Our next conceptual step will be to consider images. Before we do so, we need to review a number of statistical basics and details on how to compute models efficiently.
