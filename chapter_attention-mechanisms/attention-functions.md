# Attention Functions
:label:`sec_attention-functions`

In :numref:`sec_seq2seq`, we encode the source sequence input information in the recurrent unit state and then pass it to the decoder to generate the target sequence. A token in the target sequence may closely relate to one or more tokens in the source sequence, instead of the whole source sequence. For example, when translating "Hello world." to "Bonjour le monde.", "Bonjour" maps to "Hello" and "monde" maps to "world". In the seq2seq model, the decoder may implicitly select the corresponding information from the state passed by the encoder. The attention mechanism, however, makes this selection explicit.


*Attention* is a generalized pooling method with bias alignment over inputs. The core component in the attention mechanism is the attention layer, or called *attention* for simplicity. An input of the attention layer is called a *query*. For a query, attention returns an output based on the memory---a set of key-value pairs encoded in the attention layer. To be more specific, assume that the memory contains $n$ key-value pairs, $(\mathbf{k}_1, \mathbf{v}_1), \ldots, (\mathbf{k}_n, \mathbf{v}_n)$, with $\mathbf{k}_i \in \mathbb R^{d_k}$, $\mathbf{v}_i \in \mathbb R^{d_v}$. Given a query $\mathbf{q} \in \mathbb R^{d_q}$, the attention layer returns an output $\mathbf{o} \in \mathbb R^{d_v}$ with the same shape as the value.

:label:`fig_attention`


The full process of attention mechanism is expressed in :numref:`fig_attention_output`. To compute the output of attention, we first use a score function $\alpha$ that measures the similarity between the query and the key. So for each key $\mathbf{k}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{k}_n$, we compute the scores $a_1, \ldots, a_n$ by

$$a_i = \alpha(\mathbf q, \mathbf k_i).$$

Next we use softmax to obtain the attention weights, i.e.,

$$\mathbf{b} = \mathrm{softmax}(\mathbf{a})\quad \text{, where }\quad
{b}_i = \frac{\exp(a_i)}{\sum_j \exp(a_j)}, \mathbf{b} = [b_1, \ldots, b_n]^T .$$


Finally, the output is a weighted sum of the values:

$$\mathbf o = \sum_{i=1}^n b_i \mathbf v_i.$$


![The attention output is a weighted sum of the values.](../img/attention-output.svg)
:label:`fig_attention_output`



Different choices of the score function lead to different attention layers. Below, we introduce two commonly used attention layers. Before diving into the implementation, we first express two operators to get you up and running: a masked version of the softmax operator `masked_softmax` and a specialized dot operator `batch_dot`.

```{.python .input}
import math
from d2l import mxnet as d2l
from mxnet import np, npx
from mxnet.gluon import nn
npx.set_np()
```

```{.python .input}
#@tab pytorch
from d2l import torch as d2l
import math
import torch
from torch import nn
```

The masked softmax takes a 3-dimensional input and enables us to filter out some elements by specifying a valid length for the last dimension. (Refer to
:numref:`sec_machine_translation` for the definition of a valid length.) As a result, any value outside the valid length will be masked as $0$. Let us implement the `masked_softmax` function.

```{.python .input}
#@save
def masked_softmax(X, valid_lens):
    """Perform softmax operation by masking elements on the last axis."""
    # `X`: 3D tensor, `valid_lens`: 1D or 2D tensor
    if valid_lens is None:
        return npx.softmax(X)
    else:
        shape = X.shape
        if valid_lens.ndim == 1:
            valid_lens = valid_lens.repeat(shape[1])
        else:
            valid_lens = valid_lens.reshape(-1)
        # On the last axis, replace masked elements with a very large negative
        # value, whose exponentiation outputs 0
        X = npx.sequence_mask(X.reshape(-1, shape[-1]), valid_lens, True,
                              value=-1e6, axis=1)
        return npx.softmax(X).reshape(shape)
```

```{.python .input}
#@tab pytorch
#@save
def masked_softmax(X, valid_lens):
    """Perform softmax operation by masking elements on the last axis."""
    # `X`: 3D tensor, `valid_lens`: 1D or 2D tensor
    if valid_lens is None:
        return nn.functional.softmax(X, dim=-1)
    else:
        shape = X.shape
        if valid_lens.dim() == 1:
            valid_lens = torch.repeat_interleave(valid_lens, shape[1])
        else:
            valid_lens = valid_lens.reshape(-1)
        # On the last axis, replace masked elements with a very large negative
        # value, whose exponentiation outputs 0
        X = d2l.sequence_mask(X.reshape(-1, shape[-1]), valid_lens,
                              value=-1e6)
        return nn.functional.softmax(X.reshape(shape), dim=-1)
```

To illustrate how this function works, we construct two $2 \times 4$ matrices as the input. In addition, we specify that the valid length equals to 2 for the first example, and 3 for the second example. Then, as we can see from the following outputs, the values outside valid lengths are masked as zero.

```{.python .input}
masked_softmax(np.random.uniform(size=(2, 2, 4)), d2l.tensor([2, 3]))
```

```{.python .input}
#@tab pytorch
masked_softmax(torch.rand(2, 2, 4), torch.tensor([2, 3]))
```

Similarly, we can pass a 2D tensor via the `valid_lens` argument.

```{.python .input}
masked_softmax(np.random.uniform(size=(2, 2, 4)),
               d2l.tensor([[1, 3], [2, 4]]))
```

```{.python .input}
#@tab pytorch
masked_softmax(torch.rand(2, 2, 4), d2l.tensor([[1, 3], [2, 4]]))
```

## Scaled Dot-Product Attention

Equipped with the above `masked_softmax` function and the batch multiplication operator as described in :numref:`subsec_batch_dot`, let us dive into the details of two widely used attention layers. The first one is the *scaled dot product attention*: it assumes that the query has the same dimension as the keys, namely $\mathbf q, \mathbf k_i \in\mathbb R^d$ for all $i$. The dot product attention computes the scores by a dot product between the query and a key, which is then divided by $\sqrt{d}$ to minimize the unrelated influence of the dimension $d$ on the scores. In other words,

$$\alpha(\mathbf q, \mathbf k) = \langle \mathbf q, \mathbf k \rangle /\sqrt{d}.$$


Beyond the single-dimensional queries and keys, we can always generalize them to multi-dimensional queries and keys. Assume that $\mathbf Q\in\mathbb R^{m\times d}$ contains $m$ queries and $\mathbf K\in\mathbb R^{n\times d}$ has all the $n$ keys. We can compute all $mn$ scores by

$$\alpha(\mathbf Q, \mathbf K) = \mathbf Q \mathbf K^\top /\sqrt{d}.$$
:eqlabel:`eq_alpha_QK`

With :eqref:`eq_alpha_QK`, we can implement the dot product attention layer `DotProductAttention` that supports a batch of queries and key-value pairs. In addition, for regularization we also use a dropout layer.

```{.python .input}
#@save
class DotProductAttention(nn.Block):
    """Dot product attention."""
    def __init__(self, dropout, **kwargs):
        super(DotProductAttention, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)

    # Shape of `queries`: (`batch_size`, no. of queries, `d`)
    # Shape of `keys`: (`batch_size`, no. of key-value pairs, `d`)
    # Shape of `values`: (`batch_size`, no. of key-value pairs, value
    # dimension)
    # Shape of `valid_lens`: (`batch_size`,) or (`batch_size`, some value)
    def forward(self, queries, keys, values, valid_lens=None):
        d = queries.shape[-1]
        # Set `transpose_b=True` to swap the last two dimensions of `keys`
        scores = npx.batch_dot(queries, keys, transpose_b=True) / math.sqrt(d)
        attention_weights = self.dropout(masked_softmax(scores, valid_lens))
        return npx.batch_dot(attention_weights, values)
```

```{.python .input}
#@tab pytorch
#@save
class DotProductAttention(nn.Module):
    """Dot product attention."""
    def __init__(self, dropout, **kwargs):
        super(DotProductAttention, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)

    # Shape of `queries`: (`batch_size`, no. of queries, `d`)
    # Shape of `keys`: (`batch_size`, no. of key-value pairs, `d`)
    # Shape of `values`: (`batch_size`, no. of key-value pairs, value
    # dimension)
    # Shape of `valid_lens`: (`batch_size`,) or (`batch_size`, some value)
    def forward(self, queries, keys, values, valid_lens=None):
        d = queries.shape[-1]
        # Set `transpose_b=True` to swap the last two dimensions of `keys`
        scores = torch.bmm(queries, keys.transpose(1,2)) / math.sqrt(d)
        attention_weights = self.dropout(masked_softmax(scores, valid_lens))
        return torch.bmm(attention_weights, values)
```

Let us test the class `DotProductAttention` in a toy example.
First, create two batches, where each batch has one query and 10 key-value pairs.
Via the `valid_lens` argument,
we specify that we will check the first $2$ key-value pairs for the first batch and $6$ for the second one. Therefore, even though both batches have the same query and key-value pairs, we obtain different outputs.
Since every key is the same, the attention weights are uniform.

```{.python .input}
attn = DotProductAttention(dropout=0.5)
attn.initialize()
queries, keys = d2l.normal(0, 1, (2, 1, 2)), d2l.ones((2, 10, 2))
# The two value matrices in the `values` minibatch are identical
values = np.arange(40).reshape(1, 10, 4).repeat(2, axis=0)
valid_lens = d2l.tensor([2, 6])
attn(queries, keys, values, valid_lens)
```

```{.python .input}
#@tab pytorch
attn = DotProductAttention(dropout=0.5)
attn.eval()
queries, keys = d2l.normal(0, 1, (2, 1, 2)), d2l.ones((2, 10, 2))
# The two value matrices in the `values` minibatch are identical
values = torch.arange(40, dtype=torch.float32).reshape(1, 10, 4).repeat(
    2, 1, 1)
valid_lens = d2l.tensor([2, 6])
attn(queries, keys, values, valid_lens)
```

As we can see above, dot product attention simply multiplies the query and key together, and hopes to derive their similarities from there. Whereas, the query and key may not be of the same dimension.
To address such an issue,
we may resort to the additive attention.



## Additive Attention

In *additive attention*, we project both query and keys into $\mathbb R^{h}$ by learnable weights parameters.
Assume that the learnable weights are $\mathbf W_k\in\mathbb R^{h\times d_k}$, $\mathbf W_q\in\mathbb R^{h\times d_q}$, and $\mathbf v\in\mathbb R^{h}$. Then the score function is defined by

$$\alpha(\mathbf q, \mathbf k) = \mathbf w_v^\top \text{tanh}(\mathbf W_q\mathbf q + \mathbf W_k \mathbf k).$$

Intuitively, you can imagine $\mathbf W_q\mathbf q + \mathbf W_k \mathbf k$ as concatenating the key and value in the feature dimension and feeding them to a single hidden layer perceptron with hidden layer size $h$ and output layer size $1$. In this hidden layer, the activation function is $\tanh$ and no bias is applied. Now let us implement the MLP attention.

```{.python .input}
#@save
class AdditiveAttention(nn.Block):
    """Additive attention."""
    def __init__(self, num_hiddens, dropout, **kwargs):
        super(AdditiveAttention, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        # Use `flatten=False` to only transform the last axis so that the
        # shapes for the other axes are kept the same
        self.W_k = nn.Dense(num_hiddens, use_bias=False, flatten=False)
        self.W_q = nn.Dense(num_hiddens, use_bias=False, flatten=False)
        self.w_v = nn.Dense(1, use_bias=False, flatten=False)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)

    def forward(self, queries, keys, values, valid_lens):
        queries, keys = self.W_q(queries), self.W_k(keys)
        # After dimension expansion, shape of `queries`: (`batch_size`, no. of
        # queries, 1, `num_hiddens`) and shape of `keys`: (`batch_size`, 1,
        # no. of key-value pairs, `num_hiddens`). Sum them up with
        # broadcasting
        features = np.expand_dims(queries, axis=2) + np.expand_dims(
            keys, axis=1)
        features = np.tanh(features)
        # There is only one output of `self.w_v`, so we remove the last
        # one-dimensional entry from the shape. Shape of `scores`:
        # (`batch_size`, no. of queries, no. of key-value pairs)
        scores = np.squeeze(self.w_v(features), axis=-1)
        attention_weights = self.dropout(masked_softmax(scores, valid_lens))
        # Shape of `values`: (`batch_size`, no. of key-value pairs, value
        # dimension)
        return npx.batch_dot(attention_weights, values)
```

```{.python .input}
#@tab pytorch
#@save
class AdditiveAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, key_size, query_size, num_hiddens, dropout, **kwargs):
        super(AdditiveAttention, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.W_k = nn.Linear(key_size, num_hiddens, bias=False)
        self.W_q = nn.Linear(query_size, num_hiddens, bias=False)
        self.w_v = nn.Linear(num_hiddens, 1, bias=False)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)

    def forward(self, queries, keys, values, valid_lens):
        queries, keys = self.W_q(queries), self.W_k(keys)
        # After dimension expansion, shape of `queries`: (`batch_size`, no. of
        # queries, 1, `num_hiddens`) and shape of `keys`: (`batch_size`, 1,
        # no. of key-value pairs, `num_hiddens`). Sum them up with
        # broadcasting
        features = queries.unsqueeze(2) + keys.unsqueeze(1)
        features = torch.tanh(features)
        # There is only one output of `self.w_v`, so we remove the last
        # one-dimensional entry from the shape. Shape of `scores`:
        # (`batch_size`, no. of queries, no. of key-value pairs)
        scores = self.w_v(features).squeeze(-1)
        attention_weights = self.dropout(masked_softmax(scores, valid_lens))
        # Shape of `values`: (`batch_size`, no. of key-value pairs, value
        # dimension)
        return torch.bmm(attention_weights, values)
```

To test the above `AdditiveAttention` class, we use the same inputs as in the previous toy example.
Recall that since every key is the same, the attention weights are uniform.
As we can see below, though `AdditiveAttention` contains an additional MLP model, we obtain the same output as for `AdditiveAttention`.

```{.python .input}
attn = AdditiveAttention(num_hiddens=8, dropout=0.1)
attn.initialize()
attn(queries, keys, values, valid_lens)
```

```{.python .input}
#@tab pytorch
attn = AdditiveAttention(key_size=2, query_size=2, num_hiddens=8, dropout=0.1)
attn.eval()
attn(queries, keys, values, valid_lens)
```

## Summary

* An attention layer explicitly selects related information.
* An attention layer's memory consists of key-value pairs, so its output is close to the values whose keys are similar to the queries.
* Two commonly used attention models are dot product attention and MLP attention.
