# Large-Scale Pretraining with Transformers
:label:`sec_large-pretraining-transformers`

So far in our image classification and machine translation experiments,
models were trained on datasets with input-output examples 
*from scratch* to perform specific tasks. 
For example, a Transformer was trained 
with English-French pairs (:numref:`sec_transformer`) 
so that this model can translate input English text into French. 
As a result, each model becomes a *specific expert* 
that is sensitive to even slight shift in data distribution 
(:numref:`sec_environment-and-distribution-shift`).
For better generalized models, or even more competent *generalists* 
that can perform multiple tasks with or without adaptation, 
*pretraining* models on large data has been increasingly common.

Given larger data for pretraining, the Transformer architecture 
performs better with an increased model size and training compute, 
demonstrating superior *scaling* behavior. 
Specifically, performance of Transformer-based language models 
scales as a power-law with the amount of model parameters, 
training tokens, and training compute :cite:`kaplan2020scaling`. 
The scalability of Transformers is also evidenced
by the significantly boosted performance
from larger vision Transformers trained on larger data 
(discussed in :numref:`sec_vision-transformer`).
More recent success stories include Gato, a *generalist* model 
that can play Atari, caption images, chat, and act as a robot :cite:`reed2022generalist`. Gato is a single  Transformer that scales well when pretrained on diverse modalities,
including text, images, joint torques, and button presses. 
Notably, all such multi-modal data is serialized into a flat sequence of tokens, 
which can be processed akin to text tokens (:numref:`sec_transformer`)
or image patches (:numref:`sec_vision-transformer`) by Transformers.

Before compelling success of pretraining Transformers for multi-modal data,
Transformers were extensively pretrained  with a wealth of text.
Originally proposed for machine translation,
the Transformer architecture in :numref:`fig_transformer` 
consists of an encoder for representing input sequences 
and a decoder for generating target sequences. 
Primarily, Transformers can be used in three different modes: 
*encoder-only*, *encoder-decoder*, and *decoder-only*. 
To conclude this chapter, we will review these three modes 
and explain the scalability in pretraining Transformers.

## Encoder-Only

When only the Transformer encoder is used, 
a sequence of input tokens is converted 
into the same number of representations 
that can be further projected into output 
(e.g., classification). A Transformer encoder 
consists of  self-attention layers, 
where all input tokens attend to each other.
For example, vision Transformers depicted in :numref:`fig_vit` 
are encoder-only, converting a sequence of input image patches into
the representation of a special “&lt;cls&gt;” token.
Since this representation depends on all input tokens, 
it is further projected into classification labels. 
This design was inspired by an earlier encoder-only Transformer
pretrained on text: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) :cite:`Devlin.Chang.Lee.ea.2018`.


### Pretraining BERT

Each token along the vertical axis attends to all input tokens along the horizontal axis.](../img/bert-encoder-only.svg)
:label:`fig_bert-encoder-only`

BERT is pretrained on text sequences using *masked language modeling*: 
input text with randomly masked tokens is fed 
into a Transformer encoder to predict the masked tokens. 
As illustrated in :numref:`fig_bert-encoder-only`, 
an original text sequence "I", "love", "this", "red", "car" 
is prepended with the “&lt;cls&gt;” token, and the “&lt;mask&gt;” token 
randomly replaces "love"; then the cross-entropy loss between the masked token "love" 
and its prediction is to be minimized during pretraining. 
Note that there is no constraint in the attention pattern of Transformer encoders 
(right of :numref:`fig_bert-encoder-only`) 
so all tokens can attend to each other. 
Thus, prediction of "love" depends on input tokens before and after it in the sequence. 
This is why BERT is a "bidirectional encoder".
Without need for manual labeling, large-scale text data
from books and Wikipedia can be used for pretraining BERT.


### Fine-Tuning BERT

The pretrained BERT can be *fine-tuned* to downstream encoding tasks involving single text or text pairs. During fine-tuning, additional layers can be added to BERT with randomized parameters: these parameters and those pretrained BERT parameters will be *updated* to fit training data of downstream tasks.

![Fine-tuning BERT for sentiment analysis.](../img/bert-finetune-classification.svg)
:label:`fig_bert-finetune-classification`

:numref:`fig_bert-finetune-classification` illustrates
fine-tuning of BERT for sentiment analysis.
The Transformer encoder is a pretrained BERT,
which takes a text sequence as input 
and feeds the “&lt;cls&gt;” representation 
(global representation of the input) 
into an additional fully connected layer
to predict the sentiment. 
During fine-tuning, the cross-entropy loss 
between the prediction and the label
on sentiment analysis data
is minimized via gradient-based algorithms, 
where the additional layer is trained from scratch 
while pretrained parameters of BERT are updated.
BERT does more than sentiment analysis. 
The general language representations learned
by the 350-million-parameter BERT 
from 250 billion training tokens 
advanced the state of the art for natural language tasks 
such as single text classification, 
text pair classification or regression, 
text tagging, and question answering.

You may note that these downstream tasks include text pair understanding.
BERT pretraining has another loss for predicting
whether one sentence immediately follows the other.
However, this loss was later found not useful when pretraining RoBERTa,
a BERT variant of the same size, on 2000 billion tokens :cite:`liu2019roberta`.
Other derivatives of BERT improved model architectures or pretraining objectives,
such as ALBERT (enforcing parameter sharing) :cite:`lan2019albert`,
SpanBERT (representing and predicting spans of text) :cite:`joshi2020spanbert`,
DistilBERT (lightweight via knowledge distillation) :cite:`sanh2019distilbert`,
and ELECTRA (replaced token detection) :cite:`clark2019electra`.
Moreover, BERT inspired Transformer pretraining in computer vision,
such as with vision Transformers :cite:`Dosovitskiy.Beyer.Kolesnikov.ea.2021`,
Swin Transformers :cite:`liu2021swin`,
and MAE (masked autoencoders) :cite:`he2022masked`.

## Encoder-Decoder

Since a Transformer encoder converts a sequence of input tokens 
into the same number of output representations, 
the encoder-only mode cannot generate a sequence of arbitrary length like in machine translation. 
As originally proposed for machine translation, 
the Transformer architecture can be outfitted with a decoder 
that autoregressively predicts the target sequence 
of arbitrary length, token by token, 
conditional on both encoder output and decoder output:
(i) for conditioning on encoder output, encoder-decoder cross-attention 
(multi-head attention of decoder in :numref:`fig_transformer`) 
allows target tokens to attend to *all* input tokens;
(ii) conditioning on decoder output is achieved 
by a so-called *causal* attention
(this name is common in the literature but is misleading 
as it has little connection to the proper study of causality)
pattern (masked multi-head attention of decoder in :numref:`fig_transformer`),
where any target token can only attend to *past* and *present* tokens in the target sequence.

To pretrain encoder-decoder Transformers beyond human-labeled machine translation data,
BART :cite:`lewis2019bart` and T5 :cite:`raffel2020exploring` 
are two concurrently proposed encoder-decoder Transformers 
pretrained on large-scale text corpora. 
Both attempt to reconstruct original text in their pretraining objectives,
while the former emphasizes noising input 
(e.g., masking, deletion, permutation, and rotation)
and the latter highlights multitask unification 
with comprehensive ablation studies.


### Pretraining T5


As an example of the pretrained Transformer encoder-decoder, 
T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) 
unifies many tasks as the same text-to-text problem: 
for any task, the input of the encoder is a task description 
(e.g., "Summarize", ":") followed by task input 
(e.g., a sequence of tokens from an article), 
and the decoder predicts the task output 
(e.g., a sequence of tokens summarizing the input article). 
To perform as text-to-text, T5 is trained
to generate some target text conditional on input text.


![Left: Pretraining T5 by predicting consecutive spans. The original sentence is "I", "love", "this", "red", "car", where "love" is replaced by a special “&lt;X&gt;” token, and consecutive "red", "car" are replaced by a special “&lt;Y&gt;” token. The target sequence ends with a special “&lt;Z&gt;” token. Right: Attention pattern in the Transformer encoder-decoder. In the encoder self-attention (lower square), all input tokens attend to each other; In the encoder-decoder cross-attention (upper rectangle), each target token attends to all input tokens; In the decoder self-attention (upper triangle), each target token  attends to present and past target tokens only (causal).](../img/t5-encoder-decoder.svg)
:label:`fig_t5-encoder-decoder`

To obtain input and output from any original text, 
T5 is pretrained to predict consecutive spans. 
Specifically, tokens from text are randomly replaced 
by special tokens where each consecutive span 
is replaced by the same special token. 
Consider the example in :numref:`fig_t5-encoder-decoder`, 
where the original text is "I", "love", "this", "red", "car". 
Tokens "love", "red", "car" are randomly replaced by special tokens. 
Since "red" and "car" are a consecutive span, 
they are replaced by the same special token.
As a result, the input sequence is "I", "&lt;X&gt;", "this", "&lt;Y&gt;",
and the target sequence is 
"&lt;X&gt;", "love", "&lt;Y&gt;", "red", "car", "&lt;Z&gt;",
where "&lt;Z&gt;" is another special token marking the end. 
As shown in :numref:`fig_t5-encoder-decoder`, 
the decoder has a causal attention pattern to prevent itself
from attending to future tokens during sequence prediction.

In T5, predicting consecutive span is also referred to 
as reconstructing corrupted text. 
With this objective, T5 is pretrained 
with 1000 billion tokens from the C4 
(Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus) data, 
which consists of clean English text 
from the Web :cite:`raffel2020exploring`.

### Fine-Tuning T5

Similar to BERT, T5 needs to be fine-tuned (updating T5 parameters) 
on task-specific training data to perform this task. 
Major differences from BERT fine-tuning include: 
(i) T5 input includes task descriptions; 
(ii) T5 can generate sequences 
with arbitrary length 
with its Transformer decoder; 
(iii) No additional layers are required.

![Fine-tuning T5 for text summarization. Both the task description and article tokens are fed into the Transformer encoder for predicting the summary.](../img/t5-finetune-summarization.svg)
:label:`fig_t5-finetune-summarization`

:numref:`fig_t5-finetune-summarization` 
explains fine-tuning T5 
using text summarization as an example. 
In this downstream task, 
the task description tokens "Summarize", ":" 
followed by the article tokens are input to the encoder.

After fine-tuning, the 11-billion-parameter T5 (T5-11B) 
achieved state-of-the-art results on multiple encoding (e.g., classification) 
and generation (e.g., summarization) benchmarks. 
Since released, T5 has been extensively used in later research.
For example, switch Transformers are designed based off T5 
to activate a subset of the parameters 
for better computational efficiency :cite:`fedus2022switch`. 
In a text-to-image model called Imagen,
text is input to a frozen T5 encoder (T5-XXL)
with 4.6 billion parameters :cite:`saharia2022photorealistic`. 
The photorealistic text-to-image examples in :numref:`fig_imagen` 
suggest that the T5 encoder alone may effectively 
represent text even without fine-tuning.

## Decoder-Only


We have reviewed encoder-only and encoder-decoder Transformers.
Alternatively, decoder-only Transformers 
remove the entire encoder and the decoder sublayer 
with the encoder-decoder cross-attention 
from the original encoder-decoder architecture
depicted in :numref:`fig_transformer`. 
Nowadays, decoder-only Transformers have been the de facto architecture 
in large-scale language modeling (:numref:`sec_language-model`), 
which leverages the world's abundant unlabeled text corpora via self-supervised learning.



### GPT and GPT-2

Using language modeling as the training objective, 
the GPT (generative pre-training) model 
chooses a Transformer decoder 
as its backbone :cite:`Radford.Narasimhan.Salimans.ea.2018`.

![Left: Pretraining GPT with language modeling. The target sequence is the input sequence shifted by one token. Both “&lt;bos&gt;” and “&lt;eos&gt;” are special tokens marking the beginning and end of sequences, respectively. Right: Attention pattern in the Transformer decoder. Each token along the vertical axis attends to only its past tokens along the horizontal axis (causal).](../img/gpt-decoder-only.svg)
:label:`fig_gpt-decoder-only`

Following the autoregressive language model training 
as described in :numref:`subsec_partitioning-seqs`,
:numref:`fig_gpt-decoder-only` illustrates 
GPT pretraining with a Transformer encoder, 
where the target sequence is the input sequence shifted by one token. 
Note that the attention pattern in the Transformer decoder
enforces that each token can only attend to its past tokens 
(future tokens cannot be attended to because they have not yet been chosen).


GPT has 100 million parameters and needs to be 
fine-tuned for individual downstream tasks. 
A much larger Transformer-decoder language model,
GPT-2, was introduced one year later :cite:`Radford.Wu.Child.ea.2019`. 
Compared with the original Transformer decoder in GPT, pre-normalization 
(discussed in :numref:`subsec_vit-encoder`) 
and improved initialization and weight-scaling were adopted in GPT-2.
Pretrained on 40 GB of text, the 1.5-billion-parameter
GPT-2 obtained the state-of-the-art results on language modeling benchmarks 
and promising results on multiple other tasks 
*without updating the parameters or architecture*.


### GPT-3

GPT-2 demonstrated potential of using the same language model 
for multiple tasks without updating the model. 
This is more computationally efficient than fine-tuning, 
which requires model updates via gradient computation.


![Zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot learning with language models (Transformer decoders). No parameter update is needed.](../img/gpt-3-xshot.svg)
:label:`fig_gpt-3-xshot`

Before explaining the more computationally efficient use 
of language models without parameter update,
recall :numref:`sec_rnn-scratch` that a language model 
can be trained to generate a text sequence 
conditional on some prefix text sequence. 
Thus, a pretrained language model may generate the task output 
as a sequence *without parameter update*, 
conditional on an input sequence with the task description, 
task-specific input-output examples, and a prompt (task input).
This learning paradigm can be further categorized 
into *zero-shot*, *one-shot*, and *few-shot*, 
when there is no, one, or a few task-specific input-output examples, 
respectively (:numref:`fig_gpt-3-xshot`).


![Aggregate performance of GPT-3 for all 42 accuracy-denominated benchmarks (caption adapted and figure taken from :citet:`brown2020language`).](../img/gpt3-xshot-scaling.png)
:width:`400px`
:label:`fig_gpt3-xshot-scaling`

These three settings were tested in GPT-3 :cite:`brown2020language`, 
whose largest version uses data and model size 
about two orders of magnitude larger than those in GPT-2. 
GPT-3 uses the same Transformer decoder architecture 
in its direct predecessor GPT-2 
except that attention patterns 
(right of :numref:`fig_gpt-decoder-only`)
are sparser at alternating layers. 
Pretrained with 300 billion tokens, 
GPT-3 performs better with larger model size, 
where few-shot performance increases most rapidly (:numref:`fig_gpt3-xshot-scaling`).
Although enjoying computational efficiency,
GPT-3 few-shot learning underperformed 
the state-of-the-art fine-tuned models 
that require model updates. 
Nonetheless, GPT-3 has powered a wide range 
of downstream applications [across the Web](https://gpt3demo.com/): 
it was generating 4.5 billions words every day 
around nine months of its [API](https://openai.com/api/) release.

## Scalability

:numref:`fig_gpt3-xshot-scaling` empirically demonstrates scalability 
of Transformers in the GPT-3 language model. 
For language modeling, more comprehensive empirical studies 
on the scalability of Transformers have led researchers to see promise 
in training larger Transformers with more data and compute :cite:`kaplan2020scaling`.

![Transformer language model performance improves smoothly as we increase the model size, dataset size, and amount of compute used for training. For optimal performance all three factors must be scaled up in tandem. Empirical performance has a power-law relationship with each individual factor when not bottlenecked by the other two (caption adapted and figure taken from :citet:`kaplan2020scaling`).](../img/scaling-power-law.png)
:width:`700px`
:label:`fig_scaling-power-law3`

As shown in :numref:`fig_scaling-power-law3`, 
*power-law scaling* can be observed in the performance
with respect to the model size (number of parameters, excluding embedding layers),
dataset size (number of training tokens),
and amount of training compute (PetaFLOP/s-days, excluding embedding layers). 
In general, increasing all these three factors in tandem leads to better performance. 
However, *how* to increase them in tandem 
still remains a matter of debate :cite:`hoffmann2022training`.

![Transformer language model training runs (figure taken from :citet:`kaplan2020scaling`).](../img/scaling-sample-conv.png)
:width:`700px`
:label:`fig_scaling-sample-conv`

Besides increased performance, large models also enjoy better sample efficiency than small models. :numref:`fig_scaling-sample-conv` shows that large models need fewer training samples (tokens processed) to perform at the same level achieved by small models, and performance is scaled smoothly with compute.



![GPT-3 performance (cross-entropy validation loss) follows a power-law trend with the amount of compute used for training. The power-law behavior observed in :citet:`kaplan2020scaling` continues for an additional two orders of magnitude with only small deviations from the predicted curve. Embedding parameters are excluded from compute and parameter counts (caption adapted and figure taken from :citet:`brown2020language`).](../img/scaling-gpt3.png)
:width:`400px`
:label:`fig_scaling-gpt3`


The empirical scaling behaviors in :citet:`kaplan2020scaling` have been tested in subsequent large Transformer models. For example, GPT-3 supported this hypothesis with two more orders of magnitude in :numref:`fig_scaling-gpt3`.

The scalability of Transformers in the GPT series has inspired subsequent Transformer language models. While the Transformer decoder in GPT-3 was largely followed in OPT (Open Pretrained Transformers) :cite:`zhang2022opt` using only 1/7th the carbon footprint of the former, the GPT-2 Transformer decoder was used in training the 530-billion-parameter Megatron-Turing NLG :cite:`smith2022using` with 270 billion training tokens. Following the GPT-2 design, the 280-billion-parameter Gopher :cite:`rae2021scaling` pretrained with 300 billion tokens achieved state-of-the-art performance across the majority on about 150 diverse tasks. Inheriting the same architecture and using the same compute budget of Gopher, Chinchilla :cite:`hoffmann2022training` is a substantially smaller (70 billion parameters) model that trains much longer (1.4 trillion training tokens), outperforming Gopher on many tasks. To continue the scaling line of language modeling, PaLM (Pathway Language Model) :cite:`chowdhery2022palm`, a 540-billion-parameter Transformer decoder with modified designs pretrained on 780 billion tokens, outperformed average human performance on the BIG-Bench benchmark :cite:`srivastava2022beyond`. Further training PaLM on 38.5 billion tokens containing scientific and mathematical content results in Minerva :cite:`lewkowycz2022solving`, a large language model that can answer nearly a third of
undergraduate-level problems that require quantitative reasoning, such as in physics, chemistry, biology, and economics.


## Summary and Discussion

Transformers have been pretrained as encoder-only (e.g., BERT), encoder-decoder (e.g., T5), and decoder-only (e.g., GPT series). Pretrained models may be adapted to perform different tasks with model update (e.g., fine tuning) or not (e.g., few shot). Scalability of Transformers suggests that better performance benefits from larger models, more training data, and more training compute. Since Transformers were first designed and pretrained for text data, this section leans slightly towards natural language processing. Nonetheless, those models discussed above can be often found in more recent models across multiple modalities. For example,
(i) Chinchilla :cite:`hoffmann2022training` was further extended to Flamingo :cite:`alayrac2022flamingo`, a visual language model for few-shot learning;
(ii) GPT-2 :cite:`Radford.Wu.Child.ea.2019` and the vision Transformer encode text and images in CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) :cite:`radford2021learning`, whose image and text embeddings were later adopted in the DALL-E 2 text-to-image system :cite:`ramesh2022hierarchical`. Although there has been no systematic studies on Transformer scalability in multi-modal pretraining yet, a recent all-Transformer text-to-image model, Parti :cite:`yu2022scaling`, shows potential of scalability across modalities:
a larger Parti is more capable of high-fidelity image generation and content-rich text understanding (:numref:`fig_parti`).
