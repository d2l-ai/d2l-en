# Using Google Colab
:label:`sec_colab`

We introduced how to run this book on AWS in :numref:`sec_sagemaker` and :numref:`sec_aws`. Another option is running this book on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
if you have a Google account.

To run the code of a section on Colab, simply click the `Colab` button as shown in :numref:`fig_colab`. 

![Run the code of a section on Colab](../img/colab.png)
:width:`300px`
:label:`fig_colab`


If it is your first time to run a code cell,
you will receive a warning message as shown in :numref:`fig_colab2`.
Just click "RUN ANYWAY" to ignore it.

Next, Colab will connect you to an instance to run the code of this section.
Specifically, if a GPU is needed, 
Colab will be automatically requested 
for connecting to a GPU instance.


## Summary

* You can use Google Colab to run each section's code in this book.
* Colab will be requested to connect to a GPU instance if a GPU is needed in any section of this book.


## Exercises

1. Open any section of this book using Google Colab.
1. Edit and run any section that requires a GPU using Google Colab.
