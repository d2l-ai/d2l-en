# Modern Recurrent Neural Networks
:label:`chap_modern_rnn`

The previous chapter introduced the key ideas 
behind recurrent neural networks (RNNs). 
However, just as with convolutional neural networks,
there has been a tremendous amount of innovation
in RNN architectures, culminating in several complex
designs that have proven successful in practice. 
In particular, the most popular designs 
feature mechanisms for mitigating the notorious
numerical instability faced by RNNs,
as typified by vanishing and exploding gradients.
Recall that in :numref:`chap_rnn` we dealt 
with exploding gradients by applying a blunt
gradient clipping heuristic. 
Despite the efficacy of this hack,
it leaves open the problem of vanishing gradients. 

In this chapter, we introduce the key ideas behind 
the most successful RNN architectures for sequences,
which stem from two papers.
The first, *Long Short-Term Memory* :cite:`Hochreiter.Schmidhuber.1997`,
introduces the *memory cell*, a unit of computation that replaces 
traditional nodes in the hidden layer of a network.
With these memory cells, networks are able 
to overcome difficulties with training 
encountered by earlier recurrent networks.
Intuitively, the memory cell avoids 
the vanishing gradient problem
by keeping values in each memory cell's internal state
cascading along a recurrent edge with weight 1 
across many successive time steps. 
A set of multiplicative gates help the network
to determine not only the inputs to allow 
into the memory state, 
but when the content of the memory state 
should influence the model's output. 

The second paper, *Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks* :cite:`Schuster.Paliwal.1997`,
introduces an architecture in which information 
from both the future (subsequent time steps) 
and the past (preceding time steps)
are used to determine the output 
at any point in the sequence.
This is in contrast to previous networks, 
in which only past input can affect the output.
Bidirectional RNNs have become a mainstay 
for sequence labeling tasks in natural language processing,
among a myriad of other tasks. 
Fortunately, the two innovations are not mutually exclusive, 
and have been successfully combined for phoneme classification
:cite:`Graves.Schmidhuber.2005` and handwriting recognition :cite:`graves2008novel`.


The first sections in this chapter will explain the LSTM architecture,
a lighter-weight version called the gated recurrent unit (GRU),
the key ideas behind bidirectional RNNs 
and a brief explanation of how RNN layers 
are stacked together to form deep RNNs. 
Subsequently, we will explore the application of RNNs
in sequence-to-sequence tasks, 
introducing machine translation
along with key ideas such as *encoder--decoder* architectures and *beam search*.
