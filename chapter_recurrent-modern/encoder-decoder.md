# Encoder-Decoder Architecture

The *encoder-decoder architecture* is a neural network design pattern. As shown in :numref:`fig_encoder_decoder`, the architecture is partitioned into two parts, the encoder and the decoder. The encoder's role is to encode the inputs into state, which often contains several tensors. Then the state is passed into the decoder to generate the outputs. In machine translation, the encoder transforms a source sentence, e.g., "Hello world.", into state, e.g., a vector, that captures its semantic information. The decoder then uses this state to generate the translated target sentence, e.g., "Bonjour le monde.".

:label:`fig_encoder_decoder`

In this section, we will show an interface to implement this encoder-decoder architecture.


## Encoder

The encoder is a normal neural network that takes inputs, e.g., a source sentence, to return outputs.

```{.python .input  n=2}
from mxnet.gluon import nn

# Saved in the d2l package for later use
class Encoder(nn.Block):
    """The base encoder interface for the encoder-decoder architecture."""
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(Encoder, self).__init__(**kwargs)

    def forward(self, X):
        raise NotImplementedError
```

## Decoder

The decoder has an additional method `init_state` to parse the outputs of the encoder with possible additional information, e.g., the valid lengths of inputs, to return the state it needs. In the forward method, the decoder takes both inputs, e.g., a target sentence and the state. It returns outputs, with potentially modified state if the encoder contains RNN layers.

```{.python .input  n=3}
# Saved in the d2l package for later use
class Decoder(nn.Block):
    """The base decoder interface for the encoder-decoder architecture."""
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super(Decoder, self).__init__(**kwargs)

    def init_state(self, enc_outputs, *args):
        raise NotImplementedError

    def forward(self, X, state):
        raise NotImplementedError
```

## Model

The encoder-decoder model contains both an encoder and a decoder. We implement its forward method for training. It takes both encoder inputs and decoder inputs, with optional additional arguments. During computation, it first computes encoder outputs to initialize the decoder state, and then returns the decoder outputs.

```{.python .input  n=4}
# Saved in the d2l package for later use
class EncoderDecoder(nn.Block):
    """The base class for the encoder-decoder architecture."""
    def __init__(self, encoder, decoder, **kwargs):
        super(EncoderDecoder, self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.encoder = encoder
        self.decoder = decoder

    def forward(self, enc_X, dec_X, *args):
        enc_outputs = self.encoder(enc_X, *args)
        dec_state = self.decoder.init_state(enc_outputs, *args)
        return self.decoder(dec_X, dec_state)
```

## Summary

* An encoder-decoder architecture is a neural network design pattern mainly in natural language processing.
* An encoder is a network (FC, CNN, RNN, etc.) that takes the input, and outputs a feature map, a vector or a tensor.
* An decoder is a network (usually the same network structure as encoder) that takes the feature vector from the encoder, and gives the best closest match to the actual input or intended output.


## Exercises

1. Besides machine translation, can you think of another application scenarios where an encoder-decoder architecture can fit?
1. Can you design a deep encoder-decoder architecture?
